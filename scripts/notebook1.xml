Special rate, Denver to Florissant, $4.50, pd $9.00 for Ramaley and I. Left Denver at 9:40 (40 min. late) on Colo. Midland (via C & S) for Florissant. A few miles before {{place|Castle Rock, Colorado|Castle Rock}} appeared scrub oaks on hills and long leafed pines in valleys. In valleys we saw perfectly stratified horizontal formations, with hills capped by hard horizontal rocks. Further north recognized Niobrara Ridge, Dakota Ridge and Triassic Ridge to the west of the RR. In one place, rocks like Boulder Red Rocks – possibly a short resistant zone in the Jura. Apparently the oaks are southern species pushing northward from {{place|New Mexico}}, hence occupying dry positions, while the {{taxon|Pinus|pine}}s,<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

</noinclude>{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small. Can jump across the two streams at {{place|Florissant}}   {{SIC|postoffise|post office}} now. The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	Went up track to RR cut E of town. River terrace in Lake beds there dissected by numerous gullies cut from top of mesa to base. Bright clear comfortable morning. Heard {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|flickers}} calling and {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewer’s blackbirds}} singing as I worked. 

	Station 4. RR out just around point E. of Florissant. Leaves plentiful in a narrow stratum half way to top of cut, but few good specimens comparatively. I cut a diagonal furrow from the top of the cliff well down into the talus and found leaf bearing zones an inch or two in thickness alternating with barren zones of greater thickness. The fossiliferous zones were somewhat persistent, so far as I examined. Calcite bands and yellowish strata so and pronounced at Station 1  were absent here. Strata quite wet in places, upon digging in. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant. At the upper end are forming just such beds of fine mud as compose some portion of the Florissant  lake beds. The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across.

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft. The whole capped by what may be a crumbling stratum of volcanic ash 3 or 4 feet in thickness.

But I cannot imagine why the shaft was sunk in the lake beds. 

Saw a {{taxon|kingfisher}}. Daniel Nevitt, the hotel keeper says the shaft above mentioned was sunk in search of coal because the shales got blacker as depth increased. He also says the Platte is generally not so muddy.

	This is a very bright morning. Breakfasted at 6:30 as usual. Dr. Ramaley changed dryers on his plants and we started south to the fossil stump with buggy at 8:30 a.m. Terribly hot in the sun. A male and female {{taxon|Agelaius phoeniceus|redwing blackbird}} passed the hotel before we started-the first we have seen here, though {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewers blackbird}} is quite common. 

Heard a {{taxon|chickadee}}, but too far away to determine the species.

I dug a diagonal trench at the north end of the hill while he was gone. After lunch we began a cross cut to reach the lowest part of the former workings, which gives us a fine section. Worked hard all afternoon taking turns with pick and shovel, but found only 4 {{taxon|insect}}s, though about 200  good fossil leaves, some of them being very fine. The formation there is capped by several feet of consolidated volcanic ashes. 

The fossil stump is about 6 or 8 ft in diameter. 3 saws broken off in the attempt to saw it up for transportation to the [[w:World’s Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition]] still remain in the stump. Near it is a large fossil log nearly buried. Got back to hotel at 6:30.<br />

{{dated|1905-08-05|Aug 5}}. Another bright, hot morning. The RR people keep 3 or 4 engines steamed up here all the time to help trains up the steep grade to Divide. They must waste much coal, as the escape valves hiss by the hour.

	I had a very narrow escape from the loss of an eye yesterday. While digging  in very hard rock with the big pick a piece of rock struck me a terrific blow an inch over the eye, the flat side striking, so that it did not cut much, but dazed me for a moment or two. An inch lower would have struck the right lens of my glasses, the result of which could not be safely predicted.

</noinclude>It clouded shortly after noon and sprinkled more or less during the afternoon. We finished the cross cut at the fossil stump, but found comparatively little. Made a cross cut at the northeast corner of same hill, which is locally reported to be the point of which Prof. Scudder gave a section in his monograph, but did not find the strata at all conformable to his section. It seems certain that is not the place. 

Went to the S end of the Park and over into the Arkansas drainage. If it be true, as is supposed, that the ancient lake drained at one time southward into the Arkansas, but was afterwards turned westward into the South Platte, the uprising ridge must have crossed the valley either at the very end of the lake or a little way into the lake, as we found lake beds involved with igneous rocks  and granite at what we took for the former terminus, showing in at least one place considerable movement just north of the present divide between<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

</noinclude>Arkansas and South Platte drainage. On the Arkansas side of the divide we found a park which may have originally included the lake, but we saw no sedimentary deposits there, while in all portions of what we know to have been included we find numerous outcrops. The topography there is also somewhat different, particularly in respect to the lack of steep slopes and mountain walls. It may be that there are lake beds there, but unexposed on account of gentle slopes not favoring erosion.

Mr. Nevitt, the hotel keeper, gave us some specimens of quartz and amazon stone  crystals this morning from Topaz Peak, sometimes called {{place|Crystal Peak, Teller, CO|Crystal Mt.}}, due north of Florissant. He also accompanied me to some fossil beds SW of the hotel, about a mile, this morning, where we did a little exploring, preparatory to tomorrow’s work. 

	In walking past Station 1 this evening I noticed that the dip is NW which conforms to the idea of an uplift from the SE. Have not noticed any dip before. 2 {{taxon|nighthawk|night hawks}} very tame, apparently nesting, as they circled over one spot  and soon alighted after we looked away.

<br />

{{dated|1905-08-29|'''Aug. 29, 1905'''}}

	Finished packing and loaded wagon in evening-last evening - putting tents over load to keep it dry. The load is a heavy one for two horses over a bad road. This morning opens bright and warm. Saw a {{taxon|Sayornis phoebe|phoebe}} in back yard before starting. 
	H. F. Watts, F. G. Henderson, Harvey R. Markman, Sievert Rohwer and I started by narrow gauge C & N at 9:35 for Silver Lake Siding, the wagon having gone early – Al Anderson’s wagon and good team. Train consisted of four cars to Sunset, then 2 cars to Silver Lake Siding which we reached at 11:45 p.m. (sic), 15 minutes late. At((e)) lunch at the brook NE of the siding and collected a few {{taxon|Pisidium|Pisidium abditum}} (No.1) in the brook. Then started up the hill. Began raining on Ralston Peaks before we left the train. Sprinkled at intervals during afternoon <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Watts and I reached {{place|Silver Lake, Colorado|Silver Lake}} at 3 p.m. Thinking that the other three and the team would be there but they were not, so Watts came on to select camp  and I started back. Soon met Markman who said they had taken the wrong trail soon after leaving us while we were waiting to see if the wagon was coming. He had soon seen some men who had told him his mistake and promised to send others back, but they kept on until their trail played out, then through dead timber till the((y)) struck the {{place|Camp Albion Road, Colorado|Camp Albion  road}} where they were directed across  to {{place|Silver Lake, Colorado|Silver Lake}}.

</noinclude>boys had built a leanto, thinking perhaps we might not reach them. We got everything dry, put up two tents, Watts putting his cot and most of the outfit in one tent while we spread pine boughs in the other and laid very comfortable beds of blankets, quilts and canvass (sic). Markman is now putting up a {{taxon|Spizella breweri|Brewer Sparrow}} as I write these notes by a campfire preparatory to going to bed. Only birds seen were a {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jay}}, {{taxon|Nucifraga columbiana|Clark Crows}}, {{taxon|Perisoreus canadensis|Rocky Mt. jays}}, {{taxon|Poecile|chickadees}}, {{taxon|Junco|juncos}}, {{taxon|Sialia currucoides|Mt.

Collected small caddis cases and larva (No. 2) in stream  from {{place|North Lake, Colorado|North Lake}} near {{place|High Fall, Colorado|High Fall}}, and some insects just above {{place|High Fall, Colorado|High Fall}}. The party showed fatigue in the following order: Sievert least, I next, then Watts, Then Markman, then Frank. Sievert and I went on ahead and climbed out of the cirque at {{place|he Saddle, Colorado|The Saddle}} to photograph the glacier and the range. It is a fearful climb, the loose rock sliding at every step. Were much exhausted upon reaching the top and laid down for a few moments, then took two pictures and returned to the cirque to join Frank and Watts. Ate a few malted milk tablets and raisins while sitting on a boulder on the {{place|Arapaho Glacier|glacier}}. We easily found the tablets set last year. They were set as follows: No. 1 100 paces from the bench mark on Country <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

We also found unmistakable evidence of waste all along the front of the glacier  except just west of the  terminal lake, at which latter point it remained unchanged. At the big boulder on the north east moraine it had shrunk away at least 4 or 5 feet vertically. The medial moraine between that point and the terminal lake showed much more plainly and the same was true of the drainage basin  west of the terminal lake.

We found numerous insects, dead and alive, on the glacier, particularly abundant on the dead south branch and collected quite a number. Frank found a good {{taxon|mountain sheep}} head in the moraine at a point opposite {{place|The Saddle, Colorado|The Saddle}} and Sievert and I brought it down with infinite toil, as we were already loaded down with cameras, including one big one, tripod, hammer, rocks etc. Just before leaving the glacier it hailed hard and at intervals all the way down  it rained and hailed terrifically, with crashes of thunder. The brush was so wet we were soon soaked through.

Carrying the heavy load  without pack  harness used me up and Watts probably felt the altitude, as usual the first day out. Had fried eggs for supper and they were good. Watts ate no supper. Ed Housel and another man from the sawmill called in the evening. It rained again as we were going to bed.

Rained for a few moments in afternoon, but sun set nearly clear just as Sievert returned without fish. The sun’s rays have been very hot all day but quite cool after sundown.

	White frost this morning. A pot sitting in the open which contained hot water at bedtime was covered by thin ice at sunrise. Another pot containing less cold water and one containing less hot water, neither of them was frozen. Up to this time (2:25 p.m.) there has not been a cloud in the sky, so far as I have seen. The sun’s rays are hot but a cool breeze makes it almost too cool in the shade. Frank and Sievert went fishing before sunrise, returning at 10:00 a.m. without fish. Watts started to walk to the train just before they arrived. Markman<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Took 3 photos and reached camp a little before 2. p.m. Markman not here yet. The snowbanks west of {{place|North Lake}} are crevassed, the crack probably being in the nature of the Bergschrund. As they cannot be called glaciers, it shows that crevasses above are not sufficient to indicate a glacier.

Harry is fishing and catching chubs etc. I have spent the entire afternoon in labelling and arranging the collections. Found more stuff stowed away after supper and worked until dark, with Dodds’ help. All retired at 10 p.m. My back was very lame from bending over the specimens so long at a time without proper work table. Put some fish in formaldehyde- two or three species.

Markman collected a {{taxon|garter snake}} before the rest of us were up this morning. Nothing in his traps. After breakfast, Markman went at his traps again, Dodds looked after camp affairs, while Harry and I took the big dip net and began dipping for {{taxon|mollusk|mollusks}}, but the creek was high and quite roilly, so we could see nothing, hence worked at a disadvantage. We collected quite a number of {{taxon|Ancylus}}, however, clinging to the rocks which we fished out with the net, and a few insect larva. The creek was rising so rapidly that we concluded to pack up and get off the island before the water got too deep for fording. This warm weather means water too high for stream collecting. We got off the island at 10 p.m. (sic). Then Dodds <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Collected several. Also collected {{taxon|Planorbis parvus}}, {{taxon|Physa|Physa sp.}}, {{taxon|Limnaea|Limnaea sp.}} And {{taxon|Pisidium|Pisidium sp.}} in same small stream. Found a portion of a {{taxon|Strophites}} or {{taxon|Anodonta}} shell there also. Left {{place|Loveland, Colorad|Loveland}} at 1:30. Collected {{taxon|carp}}, {{taxon|catfish}} and on((e)) specimen of {{taxon|Physa}} (perhaps {{taxon|Physa virgata|P. virgata}}) in a small, filthy brook about two miles N of {{place|Loveland}} and some {{taxon|Planorbis trivolvis}}, {{taxon|Planorbis parvus|P. parvus}} and {{taxon|Physa|Physa sp.}} in a lake further north where they were very abundant.

The wagon went on to {{place|Trilby Schoolhouse|Trilby school house}} and camped in a pasture between the school house and Fossil Ridge. Just as we turned into the pasture, in crossing a furrow, the right hind wheel dished and is a complete wreck. We unloaded, got a pole under the axle, and dragged the wagon to a camping place. Also broke another spring, the front one. All hands take it philosophically and are thankful that there are still three wheels on. Finished labelling specimens at 10 p.m. and retired.

Either a heavy dew fog or a little rain in the night as things about camp were wet. Am inclined to think it may have been fog, as it evidently creeped into the tent. This morning clouds hung low on the mountains, with an east wind, hot in the sun when sheltered from the wind, but cool and refreshing in the shade exposed to the breeze. Found fine fossils by breaking up big concretions in afternoon, Harry swinging the big sledge. Received mail for the first time since starting. In the evening Dodds and Markman developed photos until 10 p.m. in dark room of blankets thrown over tripod in tent.<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Wednesday {{dated|1906-06-13|June 13}}

Markman and Harry both complain of sour stomachs this morning. Took some soda and went without their breakfasts. Refreshing breeze this morning, from the northeast. I peeled potatoes, then chiseled out and wrapped fossils until breakfast. Started for fossil beds at 9:30 a.m. Collected fossils until about 4 p.m., without food or drink, then brought a sackful of smaller ones to camp and wrapped and packed about 150 of them. Collected about 200 specimens today, mostly small bivalves – {{taxon|Callista}}, {{taxon|Volsella}} and {{taxon|Pteria}}, selecting only the best {{taxon|Inoceramus}} to show variation- also a few {{taxon|Pinna}} and {{taxon|Scaphites nodosus}}. Hot all day when sheltered from the breeze.<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Thursday {{dated|1906-06-14|June 14, 1906}}

Up at 6 a.m., got to fossil beds at 9:15; Harry going with me. We took a canteen of water and a little lunch this time. Not quite so hot as yesterday. L. C. Bragg came out from the Agricultural College and spent an hour or so. While he was with us it rained hard and we got soaked. Fossil Ridge appears to extend for at least a mile below (south) camp (or perhaps two) and a mile northeast, so far as we have observed it. The formation much resembles the Hygiene sandstone at {{place|Left Hand Creek, Colorado|Left Hand Creek}}, but is full of great concretions of sandstone with an outer coating of iron oxide. It dips to the eastward at a very low angle. This in weathering makes a sloping<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Facing the westward escarpment is the upper Niobrara escarpment skirting the foothills as at {{place|Little Thompson Creek, Colorado|Little Thompson Creek}}. The concretions are filled with fossils, Inoceramus oblongus predominately, {{taxon|Callista|Callista sp.}} abundant, many {{taxon|Pinna lakesi}} and {{taxon|Baculites compressus}}, besides other species. A very similar sandstone ridge outcrops to the east half a mile or so.

Friday, {{dated|1906-06-15|June 15, 1906}} Harry and I took a big load of fossils and some recent mollusca, fungi and bird and mammal skins to {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft.

In {{place|Poudre Valley Reservoir}} found no mollusks, but picked up three dead shells of {{taxon|Planorbis trivolvis}} on the beach.

Thursday {{dated|1906-06-21|June 21, 1906}}

Harry and Markman obtained a team and light wagon from Slayton and started back for {{place|Eastman's Reservoir, Colorado|Eastman’s Reservoir}} this morning and Dodds and I took our wagon and started for {{place|Chalk Bluffs, Colorado|Chalk Bluffs}} ((underline added later)). Had to drive over rough prairie for three miles, with no road, but fortunately found wire fence down and thus arrived some distance. We both walked several miles, Dodds went ahead and found the spring in a ravine in the bluffs. Camped, got dinner at 1:30 and started East on foot to examine formation at 2:15. First visited the isolated conglomerate butte a couple of miles east of camp. Conglomerate consists of pebbles of granite and other igneous rocks, limestone, sandstone, quartz, agate etc., very similar to those we have found lying on the prairie all day yesterday, but here cemented with a highly calcareous cement. This suggests the former extension of the forma<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

The conglomerate is not generally very well set, crumbling readily under the hammer, with a disagreeable odor somewhat resembling dog fennel, very irritating to the nostrils. It is about 60 ft. in thickness overlying the soft calcareous mud which characterizes the formation in general, the latter, with some harder bands, extending as deeply as erosion has reached- certainly not less than 100 ft. The conglomerate is strongly cross bedded in places, and some of the pebbles are 6 or 8 inches in diameter, though it is mostly coarse sand and gravel.

They are much harder than the formation in general and the terracing suggests their segregation by waters moving along planes represented by the terraces. True bedding planes are not noticeable where the formation has become entirely concretionary and even in many other places the formation is massive, but in other places it is well stratified.

</noinclude>the first hills but not beyond. A thinner bed lower down seems more continuous here, but it plays out a short distance to the west. Some of the numerous terraces throughout the formation are conglomeratic but most of them are concretionary. Marls greatly predominate, quite soft except in concretions, effervescing strongly under acid throughout, including conglomerate. Numerous caverns are formed under overhanging ledges by dissolution of the marl beneath the conglomerate. In one place a cavern extended 18 feet back and numerous chimneys admitted storm waters, making underground drainage for some distance. Streams are sand creeks, water from springs disappearing at once, flood waters from storms choked with sand, forming almost flat beds, with steep walls, almost perpendicular.

</noinclude>of faulting. Beds are approximately horizontal, but in one place on escarpment the thick conglomerate shows a decided dip to SE. However it appears to have pitched forward into that position. W of camp there is a decided unconformity between the thick conglomerate and the marl. At first sight this seemed possibly the result of the conglomerate pressing into the soft mud, but the strata above continuing unbroken and straight vetoes this idea unless the boulders and gravel pressed in as they were deposited ((drawing in field book)). At the NW (lefthand end of section) conglomerate rapidly passes into marl, not by thinning out, but by intercalation of strata of marl between narrow strata of conglomerate. Here as elsewhere, the line dividing the conglomerate from the underlying marl is abrupt, no gradation. The two places in above section marked by circles are occupied at base by boulders.

Broke camp at 2 p.m. and arrived at deserted ranch west of {{place|Gault, Colorado|Gault P.O.}} at 6 p.m. where we went into camp. After supper several neighboring ranchers called at camp, including A. B. Hilton, to whom I had letters of introduction from Herbert Baker and Chas. E Southard. Wind blew all night last night and for a while this morning, shaking the wagon in which I slept. About noon it rained at intervals and on the road to {{place|Gault, Colorado|Gault}} it rained and hailed hard several times, with a cold, disagreeable northeast wind.

The debris slope is a gentle curve to the south, as at {{place|Chalk Bluffs, Colorado|Chalk Bluffs}}, winding ravines 10 to 25 ft. in depth, with steep walls extending out for a mile or so until they shallow to nothingness, leaving the prairie beyond free from ravines.<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Further east in the base of the conglomerate I found another {{taxon|turtle}} and Dodds and I worked on it until 6 p.m., when we had it uncovered for 3 ft in length and 2 « in width and quit for the night. It is on the hanging wall, where the conglomerate overhangs so we may not be able to extract him. The formation is not favorable to extraction. Near where we got the first turtle we encountered a beautiful little {{taxon|Bitis schneideri|spotted adder}} as we walked along a narrow ledge. Harry was in advance.

Arose at 6 a.m. Hot morning. Dodds and I went work on the fossil turtle, while Harry started to hunt the missing mare and Dodds ((Markman?)) skinned birds. Harry got Mr. Davis to hunt the mare and joined us at 1 p.m. We got the turtle nearly cut out, resting with carapace downward on a pinnacle of rock at 5:30 and began pasting cheesecloth around it, starting for camp at 6:30. Wind blew all afternoon, filling our eyes with dust as we worked and making it very disagreeable. Found the mare at camp when we returned and Markman had supper ready.

Not quite so hot this morning on account of cool easterly breeze. Sun very bright. Yesterday morning with a very heavy load, including 1 gallon of water, camp bottle of paste, bolt of cheese cloth in camp pack, big pick, heavy hammer, light picks, chisels boards etc. It took Dodds and me 1 ¬ hours to walk over here. This morning with 1 two quart canteen of water and a few crackers I walked it in 45 minutes. The {{taxon|turtle}} is near the base of concretionary stratum at top of cliff. The others soon joined me and we padded beneath the fossil all around with a moss like {{taxon|Cerastium|chickweed}} and the tender young shoots of {{taxon|Cercocarpus|mountain mahogany}}. Then while the three steadied the fossil I chipped away the supporting pinnacle. It dropped easily onto the cushion just as we had planned. We easily turned it over. Then Dodds started to {{place|Grover, Colorado|Grover}} to order lumber<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Friday, {{dated|1906-06-29|June 29, 1906}}

Dodds and Markman took the wagon around to the fossil turtle this morning, while Harry and I walked across the hill, examining his traps and collecting insects on the way. Found two {taxon|rats}} in traps. We boxed the {{taxon|turtle}} with the two inch planks which Dodds got yesterday, sawing the planks with my small trimming saw. We used the dry moss-like plants of the vicinity for packing, graded a road on the face of the cliff just below the conglomeratic shelf, to a point where the debris slope was smooth, then let it down to where we could back the wagon up to an embankment and loaded it on the wagon. Harry and Markman then took it to {{place|Grover, Colorado|Grover}} for shipment, finding that it weighed 640 pounds as boxed.

At camp I took a bath and changed my underwear and shirt, then labelled and pinned about 75 insects finishing at 8:45 p. m., while Dodds was getting supper ready to go into the stove. The boys came with the wagon at 9 p.m., and a few moments afterwards we had a good supper- salmon loaf covered with peas and crackers, cake and cocoa. The last few days have been altogether too strenuous. We are all sore and tired and very thankful the big {{taxon|turtle}} is off our hands.

The formation around Martha Sebosky’s has a decided tendency to change from yellowish to whitish, passing rather abruptly from one to the other and the upper part is emphatically a sandstone.

I found an ironstone concretion containing {{taxon|gasteropods}} resembling {{taxon|Vivipara}} and some {{taxon|bivalves}} resembling {{taxon|Corbicula}} and collected 70 and Harry found a stratum at the dam and collected therefrom 110 {{taxon|bivalves}} of two or more species. We then had lunch, fed the team and started down creek. On the way down I collected 40 more at the same place where Harry had worked while the others were looking at hawks nests. About 7 to 9 miles further down creek found a heronry and discovered an outcrop from which I took 75 specimens of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Corbicula}}, making a total of 400 specimens for the day. Also found a ledge containing many {{taxon|gasteropoda}}, so we went a mile down creek where we could get water from a well and camped. Have seen no water in creek since leaving last camp. Road has followed creek and is poor, with many gates. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Tuesday, {{dated|1906-07-03|July 3, 1906}}

Arose at 5:30, had breakfast and Harry and I started for the fossil beds at 7:20. Markman and Dodds joined us at 10:30 and by 11 a.m. we had 756 specimens. The wagon was all loaded and Markman and Dodds started to drive down west side of {{place|Crow Creek, Colorado|Crow Creek}}, while Harry and I walked a couple of miles on east side and then joined the wagon. Reached {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}} at 5 p.m. boxed and shipped the plants, fossils etc. and drove north one mile to {{place|Cache La Poudre|cache la Poudre}} to camp. Had a good beefsteak supper with bread, the first we have had for a long time. I am puzzled about the formation at last night’s camp. {{taxon|Ostrea glabra|O. glabra}}, {{taxon|Viviparus}} (sic) and one specimen of {{taxon|Physa}} indicates Laramie but some of the other species look marine to me, which would indicate Fox Hills. At the brow of the gentle slope are great quantities of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and fragments of some other {{taxon|bivalve}}<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

</noinclude>broken from iron concretions and “cone-in-cone”. In one place large numbers of {{taxon|gasteropods}} were broken from iron concretions. Down the hill some distance is a perfect mass of {{taxon|bivalves}} of several species, including a few {{taxon|gasteropods}} which I take for {{taxon|Viviparus}}. A short distance to the south a gulch has exposed what appears to be typical Laramie white sandstone containing “cannonball” concretions. As we found no other exposures except recent I am compelled suspect that this locality, though said to be 18 miles from {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}}, is the place called 15 NE of {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}} in the reports, from which ten or more Laramie species have been described. Has been a fine day but the air feels decidedly frosty tonight.

Four miles N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, Colo.}} {{dated|1907-02-12|Feby 12, 1907}}

Sievert and Frank Rohwer and I started at 9:45. Drove to where private road crosses the mesa about 3 « miles N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} and there left the rig. Where the private road crosses the Hygiene sandstone (Pierre Cretaceous) in the SW ¬ of Sec. 6, Tp. 1N, R 70 WW., we found a fossiliferous zone about 30 feet from top of exposure; 1 {{taxon|Baculites ovatus}}, 15 {{taxon|Inoceramus|Inoceramus sp.}}, a fragment of wood, some seaweeds ? and worm or mollusk burrows. Above and below this horizon the sandstone seemed barren, except for apparent seaweeds. N of the gulch which cuts this mesa off on the north and about 200 to 300 yards east of the west line of section 6, consequently beneath the Hygiene sandstone, we found <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Prof. Cannon, however, says that long observation teaches him that there is a vague, indescribable, indefinable difference between the intercalated gravel beds in {{place|Green Mountain Creek, Colorado|Green Mt.

The talus was thinnest above thickening down slope.

The pebbles and small boulders contained in these river deposits as well as in the loessoid were usually rounded, with some flattish surfaces and sometimes angular, suggesting transportation some distance at a time by strong floods without much wear, as often occurs nowadays. The pebbles left on the surface by wind erosion are of quartz, hornblende rock, andesite etc. – mountain debris. Throughout this plains region erosion and deposition have frequently progressed with terrific rapidity during great storms.

N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, Colo.}}, {{dated|1907-04-07|Apl 5/07}}

Drove north in morning, taking Frank Rohwer and Clinton Fullen with me. Visited station 2, sec 12 Tp 1 N R 70 W and found some poorly preserved {{taxon|Inoceramus|Inoceramus sp.}} and fragments of {{taxon|Baculites|Baculites sp.}} This station is some distance above the base of the Pierre group, instead of being at the base as I had supposed. W of this station I found the boulder cap of the mesa cemented into a conglomerate by a calcareous cement, as at station 3, sec 5 tp 1 N, R 70 W. Of course this being W of the Hygiene sandstone there are no Hygiene fragments, as at sta. 3 in sec. 5. We then went N to the “paper” shales, collected some {{taxon|Inoceramus labiatus|I. labiatus}}, a shark tooth and 2 specimens of the undescribed cephalopod which I<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

</noinclude>collected N of {{place|Left Hand Creek, Colorado|Left Hand}} in the Benton Cretaceous. In the Niobrara shales, just above the basal limestone, we found the {{taxon|Inoceramus deformis }}greatly flattened, except one or two specimens. This may have been due to pressure, but it did not appear to be. They are in a yielding shale. Thence we took the road connecting the roads along the E and W lines of Secs. 30 and 31 and near where it connects with the E section road, not far below the Hygiene sandstone I found a sea urchin, {{taxon|Baculites ovatus}}, {{taxon|Inoceramus barabini}} and {{taxon|Heteroceras|Heteroceras sp.}}
