Started for fossil beds at 9:30 a.m. Collected fossils until about 4 p.m., without food or drink, then brought a sackful of smaller ones to camp and wrapped and packed about 150 of them. Collected about 200 specimens today, mostly small bivalves – {{taxon|Callista}}, {{taxon|Volsella}} and {{taxon|Pteria}}, selecting only the best {{taxon|Inoceramus}} to show variation- also a few {{taxon|Pinna}} and {{taxon|Scaphites nodosus}}. Hot all day when sheltered from the breeze.

Also discovered that the new front spring is weak, – nearly broken through one leaf. We blocked this up and went on. Markman shot two young {{taxon|Nycticorax nycticorax|night herons}} or {{taxon|Ardeidae|bitterns}} at a lake south of {{place|Poudre valley Reservoir}} and we saw others. In a marsh we saw several {{taxon|Phalaropus tricolor|Wilson’s phalaropes}}. Near {{place|Windsor, Colorado|Windsor}} we crossed what I believe is Fox Hills sandstone, dipping to east. Found no identifiable fossils. At {{place|Windsor, Colorado|Windsor}}, on N side of {{place|Cache La Poudre}}, we bought provisions, then went on to

Had a very windy night. I slept in the wagon last night and night before, Harry going into the tent. Cloudy this morning and windy. I prepared and catalogued the {{taxon|mollusks}} collected yesterday, then read papers and magazines received at {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} Friday. Harry and Dodds started down the valley soon after breakfast. It sprinkled at intervals, and finally, at 1:30 p.m., rained hard, continuing for half an hour or so, and sprinkling for some time later. Harry and Dodds came in drenched to the skin and we had dinner at 3 p.m. After dinner, I walked across to the bluffs S of the creek and found

Dodds and Markman took the wagon around to the fossil turtle this morning, while Harry and I walked across the hill, examining his traps and collecting insects on the way. Found two {taxon|rats}} in traps. We boxed the {{taxon|turtle}} with the two inch planks which Dodds got yesterday, sawing the planks with my small trimming saw. We used the dry moss-like plants of the vicinity for packing, graded a road on the face of the cliff just below the conglomeratic shelf, to a point where the debris slope was smooth, then let it down to where we could back the wagon up to an embankment and loaded it on the wagon. Harry and Markman then took it to {{place|Grover, Colorado|Grover}} for shipment, finding ",,,"United States of America",US,Colorado,,,Grover,"Grover, Colorado",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The last few days have been altogether too strenuous. We are all sore and tired and very thankful the big {{taxon|turtle}} is off our hands.
