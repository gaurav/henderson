Drove north in morning, taking Frank Rohwer and Clinton Fullen with me. Visited station 2, sec 12 Tp 1 N R 70 W and found some poorly preserved {{taxon|Inoceramus|Inoceramus sp.}} and fragments of {{taxon|Baculites|Baculites sp.}} This station is some distance above the base of the Pierre group, instead of being at the base as I had supposed.

In the Niobrara shales, just above the basal limestone, we found the {{taxon|Inoceramus deformis }}greatly flattened, except one or two specimens. This may have been due to pressure, but it did not appear to be. They are in a yielding shale.
