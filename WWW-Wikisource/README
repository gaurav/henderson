WWW-Wikisource

Wikisource is a project to transcribe text from public
domain and open-licensed documents. It is managed by
the Wikimedia Foundation, the organization behind Wikipedia,
and runs the same Mediawiki software other Wikipedia-like
websites use.

This module will provide an API to access and manipulate
Wikisource documents. In particular, Wikisource differs
from other MediaWiki installations because of the 
Proofread Page extension, which allows side-by-side
transcription of text with image scans. This module is
primarily designed to expose Proofread Page features 
through other, more general Mediawiki modules, such 
as WWW-Wikipedia.
