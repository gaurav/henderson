{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions.

The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small.

The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small.

The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small. Can jump across the two streams at {{place|Florissant}}   {{SIC|postoffise|post office}} now. The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small.

The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

{{place|Florissant Lake|Florissant Lake basin}} is a mountain park divided by a ridge into two portions. The surrounding mountains are not as high and abrupt as at {{place|Estes Park}} but more rolling, and streams are small.

The old lake beds so far as we saw them today are mere remnants of former more extensive beds, and contain many bands of volcanic ash and sand, the main portion of the beds, except in patches along the edges of the marginal hills, having been eroded away. Igneous dykes border the old lake basin at various places, but as yet  see no  connection between these and the volcanic debris in the lake beds. I believe the igneous rocks are older.

	Went up track to RR cut E of town. River terrace in Lake beds there dissected by numerous gullies cut from top of mesa to base. Bright clear comfortable morning. Heard {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|flickers}} calling and {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewerâs blackbirds}} singing as I worked. 

	Station 4. RR out just around point E. of Florissant. Leaves plentiful in a narrow stratum half way to top of cut, but few good specimens comparatively. I cut a diagonal furrow from the top of the cliff well down into the talus and found leaf bearing zones an inch or two in thickness alternating with barren zones of greater thickness. The fossiliferous zones were somewhat persistent, so far as I examined. Calcite bands and yellowish strata so and pronounced at Station 1  were absent here. Strata quite wet in places, upon digging in.

Station 4 ((5)) next cut above Station 3 ((4))  being through a sort of breccia or conglomerate  of (apparently) an igneous rock containing quartz pebbles. Do not exactly understand it. Further up the RR and consequently a little higher appears a 25 foot exposure of coarse, rudely stratified rather angular gravel including at least  one continuous bed of water worn  boulders. The strata are nearly horizontal and are truncated by the slope of the hill at the west. Next cut up the hill is in granite, the gravels resting upon the granite. Collected about 275 specimens at station 4 ((5)) today. Hot a.m., cool, cloudy p.m. ((in text for Aug 3rd Henderson corrects 3 to 4 and 4 to 5))

Station 4 ((5)) next cut above Station 3 ((4))  being through a sort of breccia or conglomerate  of (apparently) an igneous rock containing quartz pebbles. Do not exactly understand it. Further up the RR and consequently a little higher appears a 25 foot exposure of coarse, rudely stratified rather angular gravel including at least  one continuous bed of water worn  boulders. The strata are nearly horizontal and are truncated by the slope of the hill at the west. Next cut up the hill is in granite, the gravels resting upon the granite.

	Went up track to RR cut E of town. River terrace in Lake beds there dissected by numerous gullies cut from top of mesa to base. Bright clear comfortable morning. Heard {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|flickers}} calling and {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewerâs blackbirds}} singing as I worked. 

	Station 4. RR out just around point E. of Florissant. Leaves plentiful in a narrow stratum half way to top of cut, but few good specimens comparatively. I cut a diagonal furrow from the top of the cliff well down into the talus and found leaf bearing zones an inch or two in thickness alternating with barren zones of greater thickness. The fossiliferous zones were somewhat persistent, so far as I examined. Calcite bands and yellowish strata so and pronounced at Station 1  were absent here.

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant. At the upper end are forming just such beds of fine mud as compose some portion of the Florissant  lake beds. The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across. The waters of the South Platte flow through Granite Canyon

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft. The whole capped by what may be a crumbling stratum of volcanic ash 3 or 4 feet in thickness.

The bluebirds here are either {{taxon|Sialia mexicana|western}} or {{taxon|Sialia mexicana bairdi|chestnut backed}}, instead of {{taxon|Sialia currucoides|mountain bluebirds}}.

Started down to {{place|Lake George, Colorado|Lake George}} at 8:40 a.m.  with horse and buggy. Lake about 5 miles below Florissant. On way saw rounded knobs which looked as if they were of glacial origin, but have found no moraines here. 

At head of Lake George, which is an artificial lake said to have been made ice purposes etc. about 15 years ago, found {{taxon| Trichoptera|caddis}} larva. Also found {{taxon| Lymnaea|Limnaea}} similar to those from Meeker, in great abundance, but only on the delta. Found a few dead shells further down the lake shore but none alive there.

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant. At the upper end are forming just such beds of fine mud as compose some portion of the Florissant  lake beds. The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across. The waters of the South Platte flow through Granite Canyon

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft. The whole capped by what may be a crumbling stratum of volcanic ash 3 or 4 feet in thickness.

It is more probable that he found one of the holes left by the crevicing of the rocks before mentioned, and {{SIC|possible|possibly}} found timbers used by Indians or prospectors in preparing the hole for shelter purposes. But I cannot imagine why the shaft was sunk in the lake beds. 

Saw a {{taxon|kingfisher}}. Daniel Nevitt, the hotel keeper says the shaft above mentioned was sunk in search of coal because the shales got blacker as depth increased. He also says the Platte is generally not so muddy.

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant. At the upper end are forming just such beds of fine mud as compose some portion of the Florissant  lake beds. The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across. The waters of the South Platte flow through Granite Canyon

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft.

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant.

The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across. The waters of the South Platte flow through Granite Canyon

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft.

At outlet of the lake, in a seepage pool just below the dam, were great numbers of {{taxon|Limnaea}}, alive, mingled with dead shells of a large {{taxon|Physa}}, but I could find none of the live Physas. The lake is formed by a dam thrown across the {{place|South Platte River}} shortly below the mouth of the stream which runs past Florissant.

The beds were very much cracked, many of the cracks being an inch or two wide and nearly a foot deep, dividing the mud into blocks from a few inches to 3 feet across. The waters of the South Platte flow through Granite Canyon

Near the western end of Florissant lake basin we found an incline shaft cut to a depth of about 50 feet through the tertiary lake beds, and 30 or 40 feet of the beds exposed above the shaft.

The fossil stump is about 6 or 8 ft in diameter. 3 saws broken off in the attempt to saw it up for transportation to the [[w:Worldâs Columbian Exposition|World's Columbian Exposition]] still remain in the stump. Near it is a large fossil log nearly buried. Got back to hotel at 6:30.<br />

The topography there is also somewhat different, particularly in respect to the lack of steep slopes and mountain walls. It may be that there are lake beds there, but unexposed on account of gentle slopes not favoring erosion.

We found the tablets and accompanying boulders had moved as follows: No. 1 -11.15 ft; No.2 -11.9 ft;. No.3 -13ft; No.4 -15.9 ft; No. 5 - 16.75ft; No.6 â18.5 ft; No.7-20.6 ft: No. 8- 20.45 ft; No.9 21.7ft; No.10 - 27.7 ft. We also found unmistakable evidence of waste all along the front of the glacier  except just west of the  terminal lake, at which latter point it remained unchanged. At the big boulder on the north east moraine it had shrunk away at least 4 or 5 feet vertically. The medial moraine between that point and the terminal lake showed much more plainly and the same was true of the drainage basin  west of the terminal lake. More ice was exposed than we

have seen except in 1902, while there is more snow in many other places  than last year, I believe. The photos will enable us to definitely decide that question by comparison. We found numerous insects, dead and alive, on the glacier, particularly abundant on the dead south branch and collected quite a number. Frank found a good {{taxon|mountain sheep}} head in the moraine at a point opposite {{place|The Saddle, Colorado|The Saddle}} and Sievert and I brought it down with infinite toil, as we were already loaded down with cameras, including one big one, tripod, hammer, rocks etc. Just before leaving the glacier it hailed hard and at intervals all the way down  it rained and hailed terrifically, with crashes of thunder. The brush was so wet we were soon soaked through. Sievert and I reached camp at 5:30 about half an hour after Frank and Markman, who started down long before us and with Watts whom we had

overtaken. Watts and I were on our âlast legsâ but the others were not so tired. I felt the trip more than I ever have before, though kept up well on the way up. Carrying the heavy load  without pack  harness used me up and Watts probably felt the altitude, as usual the first day out. Had fried eggs for supper and they were good. Watts ate no supper. Ed Housel and another man from the sawmill called in the evening. It rained again as we were going to bed.

We also found unmistakable evidence of waste all along the front of the glacier  except just west of the  terminal lake, at which latter point it remained unchanged. At the big boulder on the north east moraine it had shrunk away at least 4 or 5 feet vertically. The medial moraine between that point and the terminal lake showed much more plainly and the same was true of the drainage basin  west of the terminal lake. More ice was exposed than we

Sievert and I went on ahead and climbed out of the cirque at {{place|he Saddle, Colorado|The Saddle}} to photograph the glacier and the range.

	White frost this morning. A pot sitting in the open which contained hot water at bedtime was covered by thin ice at sunrise. Another pot containing less cold water and one containing less hot water, neither of them was frozen. Up to this time (2:25 p.m.) there has not been a cloud in the sky, so far as I have seen. The sunâs rays are hot but a cool breeze makes it almost too cool in the shade. Frank and Sievert went fishing before sunrise, returning at 10:00 a.m. without fish.

{{dated|1905-09-06|Sept. 6, 1905}}

Arose at 6 a.m. and some began packing while others got breakfast. Got wagon loaded and started at 9:15. John rode to {{place|Bluebird Road|Bluebird road}}, whence we all walked down to {{place|North Boulder Falls, Colorado|North Boulder Falls}}, where we ate lunch at 11 a.m. Were caught in several showers and hail storms, taking shelter under trees and reaching {{place|Silver Lake, Colorado|Silver Lake Siding}} at 1 p.m. where Markman shot an {{taxon|Dendroica coronata auduboni|Audubon}} or {{taxon|Dendroica coronata coronata|Myrtle warbler}}. Rained again just after reaching  the siding. Hard rains extended clear out in the valley. Lack of  sunlight prevented collecting insects on way down as we had hoped. Caught train at 2:20 p.m. Am perplexed by the entire absence of {{taxon|Turdus migratorius|robins}} on this trip. Reached {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} at 4:45, shaved, and  after supper went to office for my mail and then to University to see that collections were properly taken care of.

Dodds took pictures of valley. Left camp after a late dinner for crossing of {{place|Little Thompson Creek}}. Dodds and Markman went to {{place|Hygeine, Colorado|Hygiene}} with the wagon to ship the plant collections (including a fine collection of fungus) to Dr. Ramaley at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} who is to attend to drying, arranging and labelling them. Harry and I crossed the headland formed by the big fold in the Dakota sandstone, travelling afoot. The heat was terrific. By the time we reached the {{place|Little Thompson Creek}} at the end of the Niobrara ridge we were very tired. We took off our boots,

Dodds went nearly to the basal limestone and reports narrow, sharp folds, the apex eroded into sharp ravines cutting through the yellow upper shales ((Smoky Hill)) into the darker shales. Further east the shales round into abroad fold, then dip away sharply under the Pierre. At one point is a flat topped hill of Pierre Shale close to the creek, capped by sand and boulders, evidently isolated from the debris sheet of the plains border by erosion.

I did not get through arranging, labelling, wrapping, and boxing {{taxon|mollusca}} and fossils collected yesterday and ay before until six oâclock, when we had stewed chicken and dumplings prepared by Harry. Harry is fishing and catching chubs etc. I have spent the entire afternoon in labelling and arranging the collections. Found more stuff stowed away after supper and worked until dark, with Doddsâ help. All retired at 10 p.m. My back was very lame from bending over the specimens so long at a time without proper work table. Put some fish in formaldehyde- two or three species. Markman has put up a few bird skins, young birds, but has not yet obtained any mammals.

Markman collected a {{taxon|garter snake}} before the rest of us were up this morning. Nothing in his traps. After breakfast, Markman went at his traps again, Dodds looked after camp affairs, while Harry and I took the big dip net and began dipping for {{taxon|mollusk|mollusks}}, but the creek was high and quite roilly, so we could see nothing, hence worked at a disadvantage. We collected quite a number of {{taxon|Ancylus}}, however, clinging to the rocks which we fished out with the net, and a few insect larva. The creek was rising so rapidly that we concluded to pack up and get off the island before the water got too deep for fording. This warm weather means water too high for stream collecting. We got off the island at 10 p.m. (sic). Then Dodds

I prepared and catalogued the {{taxon|mollusks}} collected yesterday, then read papers and magazines received at {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} Friday. Harry and Dodds started down the valley soon after breakfast. It sprinkled at intervals, and finally, at 1:30 p.m., rained hard, continuing for half an hour or so, and sprinkling for some time later. Harry and Dodds came in drenched to the skin and we had dinner at 3 p.m. After dinner, I walked across to the bluffs S of the creek and found

Had a very windy night. I slept in the wagon last night and night before, Harry going into the tent. Cloudy this morning and windy. I prepared and catalogued the {{taxon|mollusks}} collected yesterday, then read papers and magazines received at {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} Friday. Harry and Dodds started down the valley soon after breakfast. It sprinkled at intervals, and finally, at 1:30 p.m., rained hard, continuing for half an hour or so, and sprinkling for some time later. Harry and Dodds came in drenched to the skin and we had dinner at 3 p.m. After dinner, I walked across to the bluffs S of the creek and found

Further east in the base of the conglomerate I found another {{taxon|turtle}} and Dodds and I worked on it until 6 p.m., when we had it uncovered for 3 ft in length and 2 Â« in width and quit for the night.

Near where we got the first turtle we encountered a beautiful little {{taxon|Bitis schneideri|spotted adder}} as we walked along a narrow ledge. Harry was in advance. I passed him the big gloves and the cyanide bottle and we collected the snake. Further along I killed a big {{taxon|rattlesnake}}, the first one I have seen on this trip. {{taxon|mockingbird|Mockingbirds}} are common here, as also the {{taxon|Tyrannus verticalis|Arkansas kingbird}}, {{taxon|Sayornis saya|Say phoebe}}, {{taxon|Hirundo rustica|barn}} and {{taxon|Petrochelidon pyrrhonota|cliff swallows}}, {{taxon|Aeronautes saxatalis|white throated swifts}} and {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}. Harry had some rhubarb pies made and Markman had a salmon loaf ready when Dodds and I arrived in camp, very tired.

and as Hilton had urged, we made a very hasty search for fossil teeth but found none. Then went to {{place|Fitche's Ranch, Colorado|Fitcheâs}} where we arrived at 4:40 and did no work. Started back by a more southerly route. The formation around Martha Seboskyâs has a decided tendency to change from yellowish to whitish, passing rather abruptly from one to the other and the upper part is emphatically a sandstone. (By the way, the formation where we dug out the {{taxon|turtle}} put an abrupt point on the picks in digging.)

Markman found fossil jaw bone at the {{place|West Butte, Colorado|West Butte}}. Formation about the same as at {{place|Davis Ranch, Colorado|Davis ranch}}. Below buttes country more cut up by erosion than valley at Davisâ but no dissected escarpment. We passed Martha Seboskyâs shack on the way to {{place|Fitche's Ranch, Colorado|Fitcheâs}}

and as Hilton had urged, we made a very hasty search for fossil teeth but found none. Then went to {{place|Fitche's Ranch, Colorado|Fitcheâs}} where we arrived at 4:40 and did no work. Started back by a more southerly route. The formation around Martha Seboskyâs has a decided tendency to change from yellowish to whitish, passing rather abruptly from one to the other and the upper part is emphatically a sandstone. (By the way, the formation where we dug out the {{taxon|turtle}} put an abrupt point on the picks in digging.)

Examined the creek bluffs below camp. At the top is a zone several (4 or 5) ft. in thickness of bituminous shale containing abundant plant fragments, underlaid by white sandstone all badly weathered and very soft, containing iron concretions. Below this is a hard stratum of sandstone a foot or two thick, which presents a strangely krinkled appearance

I found an ironstone concretion containing {{taxon|gasteropods}} resembling {{taxon|Vivipara}} and some {{taxon|bivalves}} resembling {{taxon|Corbicula}} and collected 70 and Harry found a stratum at the dam and collected therefrom 110 {{taxon|bivalves}} of two or more species. We then had lunch, fed the team and started down creek. On the way down I collected 40 more at the same place where Harry had worked while the others were looking at hawks nests. About 7 to 9 miles further down creek found a heronry and discovered an outcrop from which I took 75 specimens of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Corbicula}}, making a total of 400 specimens for the day. Also found a ledge containing many {{taxon|gasteropoda}}, so we went a mile down creek where we could get water from a well and camped. Have seen no water in creek since leaving last camp. Road has followed creek and is poor, with many gates.

Examined the creek bluffs below camp. At the top is a zone several (4 or 5) ft. in thickness of bituminous shale containing abundant plant fragments, underlaid by white sandstone all badly weathered and very soft, containing iron concretions. Below this is a hard stratum of sandstone a foot or two thick, which presents a strangely krinkled appearance

on its weathered surfaces. Strong north wind makes work disagreeable. I found an ironstone concretion containing {{taxon|gasteropods}} resembling {{taxon|Vivipara}} and some {{taxon|bivalves}} resembling {{taxon|Corbicula}} and collected 70 and Harry found a stratum at the dam and collected therefrom 110 {{taxon|bivalves}} of two or more species. We then had lunch, fed the team and started down creek. On the way down I collected 40 more at the same place where Harry had worked while the others were looking at hawks nests. About 7 to 9 miles further down creek found a heronry and discovered an outcrop from which I took 75 specimens of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Corbicula}}, making a total of 400 specimens for the day. Also found a ledge containing many {{taxon|gasteropoda}}, so we went a mile down creek where we could get water from a well and camped. Have seen no water in creek since leaving last camp. Road has followed creek and is poor, with many gates.

Arose at 5:30, had breakfast and Harry and I started for the fossil beds at 7:20. Markman and Dodds joined us at 10:30 and by 11 a.m. we had 756 specimens. The wagon was all loaded and Markman and Dodds started to drive down west side of {{place|Crow Creek, Colorado|Crow Creek}}, while Harry and I walked a couple of miles on east side and then joined the wagon. Reached {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}} at 5 p.m. boxed and shipped the plants, fossils etc. and drove north one mile to {{place|Cache La Poudre|cache la Poudre}} to camp. Had a good beefsteak supper with bread, the first we have had for a long time.

Down the hill some distance is a perfect mass of {{taxon|bivalves}} of several species, including a few {{taxon|gasteropods}} which I take for {{taxon|Viviparus}}. A short distance to the south a gulch has exposed what appears to be typical Laramie white sandstone containing âcannonballâ concretions.

Reached {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}} at 5 p.m. boxed and shipped the plants, fossils etc. and drove north one mile to {{place|Cache La Poudre|cache la Poudre}} to camp. Had a good beefsteak supper with bread, the first we have had for a long time. I am puzzled about the formation at last nightâs camp. {{taxon|Ostrea glabra|O. glabra}}, {{taxon|Viviparus}} (sic) and one specimen of {{taxon|Physa}} indicates Laramie but some of the other species look marine to me, which would indicate Fox Hills. At the brow of the gentle slope are great quantities of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and fragments of some other {{taxon|bivalve}}

broken from iron concretions and âcone-in-coneâ. In one place large numbers of {{taxon|gasteropods}} were broken from iron concretions. Down the hill some distance is a perfect mass of {{taxon|bivalves}} of several species, including a few {{taxon|gasteropods}} which I take for {{taxon|Viviparus}}. A short distance to the south a gulch has exposed what appears to be typical Laramie white sandstone containing âcannonballâ concretions. As we found no other exposures except recent I am compelled suspect that this locality, though said to be 18 miles from {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}}, is the place called 15 NE of {{place|Greeley, Colorado|Greeley}} in the reports, from which ten or more Laramie species have been described. Has been a fine day but the air feels decidedly frosty tonight.

At 6 a.m. I went to the stream with the big net looking for {{taxon|mollusks}}, but found none except some small {{taxon|Physas}} and {{taxon|Planorbis parvus}}. Reached the wagon at 7:30. Breakfast was ready. We got the wagon loaded and started at 9:20. Reached mouth of {{place|St. Vrain Creek|St. Vrain}} 5 miles distant at 10 a.m. and explored the Fox Hills deposits there. At the top we found a coarse conglomerate, some of the pebbles derived from the mountains measuring two or three inches in diameter. Beneath that a few feet is a two foot stratum composed almost entirely of {{taxon|Ostrea|Ostrea sp.}}, with a sandstone matrix. The greater part

of the beds are typical Fox Hills sandstone, with long concretions such as those at {{place|White Rocks}}, and other more tabular and extensive one which cause the formation to weather into broad-capped pinnacles. Found a few fish vertebra and some fine {{taxon|fucoids}}. Lower down, Markman and Harry found a number of species. At the base of the river cliffs are intercalated strata of shales which may be Pierre. Left there at 1:45 p.m. Reached {{place|Longmont, Colorado|Longmont}} 18 or 20 miles away at 6:30 p.m. Two livery men refused us hay and W. H.

At 6 a.m. I went to the stream with the big net looking for {{taxon|mollusks}}, but found none except some small {{taxon|Physas}} and {{taxon|Planorbis parvus}}. Reached the wagon at 7:30. Breakfast was ready. We got the wagon loaded and started at 9:20. Reached mouth of {{place|St. Vrain Creek|St. Vrain}} 5 miles distant at 10 a.m. and explored the Fox Hills deposits there. At the top we found a coarse conglomerate, some of the pebbles derived from the mountains measuring two or three inches in diameter. Beneath that a few feet is a two foot stratum composed almost entirely of {{taxon|Ostrea|Ostrea sp.}}, with a sandstone matrix. The greater part

of the beds are typical Fox Hills sandstone, with long concretions such as those at {{place|White Rocks}}, and other more tabular and extensive one which cause the formation to weather into broad-capped pinnacles. Found a few fish vertebra and some fine {{taxon|fucoids}}. Lower down, Markman and Harry found a number of species. At the base of the river cliffs are intercalated strata of shales which may be Pierre. Left there at 1:45 p.m. Reached {{place|Longmont, Colorado|Longmont}} 18 or 20 miles away at 6:30 p.m. Two livery men refused us hay and W. H. Diebens refused to allow us to camp in an unoccupied pasture, the first such refusal we have met. Camped in another pasture across on the S side of creek and W side of road. Finished supper at 9 oclock (sic).

Three former land surfaces were usually discernable: 1) The Denver sandstone, very irregular. 2) A sort of loessoid deposit containing occasional pebbles of fair size suspended somewhat regularly sloping down toward the present bed of the valley. 3) Loose material plainly derived the higher ground in the nature of talus thus ((drawing in field book)). The talus was thinnest above thickening down slope. The Denver beds were massive above with few joints, more argillaceous and thinner bedded below, thoroughly jointed by irregular joints shown by weathered surfaces. It struck me that these

The pebbles and small boulders contained in these river deposits as well as in the loessoid were usually rounded, with some flattish surfaces and sometimes angular, suggesting transportation some distance at a time by strong floods without much wear, as often occurs nowadays.
