	In catching the large (1/2 inch long)  {{taxon|water beetles}} today I noticed that I could not catch them at all by grabbing at them as they rested on the surface of the water, but never failed when I dipped my hand quickly but quietly beneath them and scooped them up. Very few clouds through the day, rather warm , sprinkled a little in evening.

saw 3 {{taxon|Catharus guttatus|hermit thrushes}}, one young. At Newcomb, 9300 ft., saw 2 {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|red shafted flicker}} and a {{taxon|western robin}}. At railroad bridge  saw a {{taxon|Chordeilinae|night hawk}} at 4:30 flying very high. The country traversed today is heavily glaciated. The Forest lake and the two above it and many others occur in a valley heading in a glacial cirque. Some are rock basins, others morainal. There are rock ridges cutting across the gulch, as at {{place|North Boulder Gulch|North Boulder}} and {{place|Camp Albion Gulch|Camp Albion}} gulches. That gulch leads into another, which in twin leads into {{place|South Boulder Creek, Colorado|South Boulder Creek}} (see map in paper by Ramaley or Robbins). Glaciation extends down {{place|South Boulder Creek, Colorado|South Boulder}} to a mile or so below {{place|Tolland, Colorado|Tolland}}. Below that we saw no plain evidence of it. Up creek a gulch coming in from the south looks even more heavily glaciated. Perhaps this is because the

topography is not so much affected by post-glacial erosion. The bird fauna as I have noticed it of this region is as follows:
{{taxon|Colaptes auratus|Red shafted flicker}}<br />
{{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewer blackbird}}<br />
{{taxon|Sphyrapicus nuchalis|Red naped sapsucker}}<br />

{{taxon|Turdus migratorius|Robin}} to timberline<br />

	The {{taxon|Turdus migratorius|robins}} I have seen are the western but a specimen taken by Robbins has the white tips of outer tail feather very distinct. 
	In catching the large (1/2 inch long)  {{taxon|water beetles}} today I noticed that I could not catch them at all by grabbing at them as they rested on the surface of the water, but never failed when I dipped my hand quickly but quietly beneath them and scooped them up. Very few clouds through the day, rather warm , sprinkled a little in evening.

	Hot bright morning. Up at 6:30, broke camp and started for {{place|Piceance Creek, Colorado|Pieance (sic) Creek}} at 8:30. Put on the odometer after travelling one mile by mile post. Saw {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}, {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|mourning doves}}, many {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|pi?on jays}}, {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jays}}, {{taxon|Tyrranus verticalis|Arkansas flycatchers}}, one {{taxon|Piranga ludoviciana|Louisiana tanager}}, {{taxon|Salpinctes obsoletus|rock wren}}. As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10Â°. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch. At one point on {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Government Creek}} there appeared to be an unconformity, sandstones resting apparently unconformably on the varicolored. However it seems to be in the axis of a fold and may be faulted.

	Hot bright morning. Up at 6:30, broke camp and started for {{place|Piceance Creek, Colorado|Pieance (sic) Creek}} at 8:30. Put on the odometer after travelling one mile by mile post.

As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10Â°. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch.

{{place|Rifle, Colorado|Rifle Gap}}, {{dated|1909-08-05|Aug 5, 1909}}

	Hot bright morning. Up at 6:30, broke camp and started for {{place|Piceance Creek, Colorado|Pieance (sic) Creek}} at 8:30. Put on the odometer after travelling one mile by mile post. Saw {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}, {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|mourning doves}}, many {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|pi?on jays}}, {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jays}}, {{taxon|Tyrranus verticalis|Arkansas flycatchers}}, one {{taxon|Piranga ludoviciana|Louisiana tanager}}, {{taxon|Salpinctes obsoletus|rock wren}}. As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10Â°. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch. At one point on {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Government Creek}} there appeared to be an unconformity, sandstones resting apparently unconformably on the varicolored. However it seems to be in the axis of a fold and may be faulted.

The {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Gov. Cr. Gulch}}, instead of approximately following the Mesa Verde - Wasatch contact, slowly passes into the latter. We reached {{place|Rio Blanco, Colorado|Rio Blanco Stage Station}}, 3/4 mil from {{place|Rio Blanco, Colorado|Rio Blanco P.O.}} ((on)) {{place|Piceance Creek}}, 20 miles N of {{place|Rifle, Colorado|Rifle}}, in {{place|Rio Blanco County, Colorado|Rio Blanco Co.}} at 5:15 p.m. and camped, having stopped for an hour shortly after noon to feed the horses., where there was little water for them. Water at {{place|Rifle Gap State Park|Rifle Gap}} was very poor, creek water being used from the creek by the ranchers and being affected by irrigation. At {{place|Piceance Creek}} it was a little better but alkaline.

{{place|Rifle, Colorado|Rifle Gap}}, {{dated|1909-08-05|Aug 5, 1909}}

	Hot bright morning. Up at 6:30, broke camp and started for {{place|Piceance Creek, Colorado|Pieance (sic) Creek}} at 8:30. Put on the odometer after travelling one mile by mile post. Saw {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}, {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|mourning doves}}, many {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|pi?on jays}}, {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jays}}, {{taxon|Tyrranus verticalis|Arkansas flycatchers}}, one {{taxon|Piranga ludoviciana|Louisiana tanager}}, {{taxon|Salpinctes obsoletus|rock wren}}. As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10Â°. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch. At one point on {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Government Creek}} there appeared to be an unconformity, sandstones resting apparently unconformably on the varicolored. However it seems to be in the axis of a fold and may be faulted.

Saw {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}, {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|mourning doves}}, many {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|pi?on jays}}, {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jays}}, {{taxon|Tyrranus verticalis|Arkansas flycatchers}}, one {{taxon|Piranga ludoviciana|Louisiana tanager}}, {{taxon|Salpinctes obsoletus|rock wren}}. As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10Â°. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch. At one point on {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Government Creek}} there appeared to be an unconformity, sandstones resting apparently unconformably on the varicolored. However it seems to be in the axis of a fold and may be faulted.

The {{place|Government Creek, Colorado|Gov. Cr. Gulch}}, instead of approximately following the Mesa Verde - Wasatch contact, slowly passes into the latter.

About 100 ft. above this is a series of burned s.s. and clays which I estimated to be 200 ft. thick, probably metamorphosed by burning of coal veins. This is overlaid by a massive s.s. like the Laramie, which in turn is overlaid by alternating s.s. etc. as below.

	Rained hard during night. Bright, warm morning. Robbins and I started out at 9 a.m., going up to {{place|Flag Creek, Colorado|Flag Creek}} road to cross river to south side. The valley here occupies the upper Mancos formation, with Mesa Verde forming strong bluffs on North side. Dip approximately 15Â° NW. The Mesa Verde, as usual, is composed mainly of sandstones, with some shales. Several coal veins crop out along the bluffs, at least one of which is being worked. Where we reached the south side of the river a low bluff is composed of shaley sandstone like portions of the Pierre north of {{taxon|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}. The south boundary of the valley is not at all abrupt. Proceeding up

valley we noted two distinct terraces on each side thus: ((drawing in field book)). Did not visit the higher one, but the lower is covered with a cap of boulders, as at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}. About 2 miles up the valley on south side the dip in the Mancos shales is a little east of south. There we found in abundance an {{taxon|Ostrea}} and numerous fragments of a large species of an {{taxon|Inoceramus}} which I cannot recognize. At that point the north slope was strewn with small {{taxon|Oreohelix}} (dead shells) and under {{taxon|Amelanchier alnifolia}}  and {{taxon|Cercocarpus|Cercocarpus parvifolius}} (mt. mahogany) [ed. not C. parvifolius] we found numbers of live ones, mostly under the former, only two or three under the latter.

{{taxon|Lymnaea palustris}} and a large {{taxon|Physa}} are abundant. Collected a few crustaceans in an irrigating ditch. Returned to camp at noon. It has been very hot walking.

At 8 p.m. we had another hard rain, with strong east wind. A storm worked eastward to the south of us earlier in the evening and another worked toward us from the southwest.

{{taxon|Lymnaea palustris}} and a large {{taxon|Physa}} are abundant. Collected a few crustaceans in an irrigating ditch. Returned to camp at noon. It has been very hot walking. Had fried chicken and lemonade for dinner. In late afternoon I turned over a few logs in a pasture near camp and collected a few {{taxon|Euconulus}}, {{taxon|Pyramidula}}, {{taxon|Zonitoides}} and one {{taxon|Agriolimax}}. {{taxon|Vallonia}} not found abundantly on this trip yet, as in eastern foothills of Colorado. At 8 p.m. we had another hard rain, with strong east wind. A storm worked eastward to the south of us earlier in the evening and another worked toward us from the southwest.

They are very pleasant gentlemen and the latter offered to supply me with specimens of  vanadium, uranium etc from this region. Later Mr. Burnham, who lives 3 miles out of town, called and told us of a fossil locality on east slope of {{place|Cedar Ridge, Colorado|Cedar Ridge}}, about 4 miles east of town.

Returned at 5:13 p.m. At about 2 p.m. it rained in camp, and sprinkled where we were, the rain coming from the southwest. Mr. Pratt, a guide, called at camp in late afternoon. Up the river I saw in addition to the usual birds, one {{taxon|Sayornis saya|Say phoebe}}, and 16 {{taxon|Corvus|ravens}} in one flock. In camp, later, saw six {{taxon|Chordeilinae|nighthawks}}.

	Rained again during night, but bright and warm this morning. At 8 a.m. I started to the bluffs north of town alone. Stopped at the Review office to see editor J. L. Riland. He gave me specimens of alleged brown and black gilsonite from {{place|Piceance Creek}}, 30 or 40 miles SW of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}, and uranium and vanadium impregnated sandstone from {{place|Coal Creek, Colorado|Coal Creek}}, 16 miles NE of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}. I noted two brick kilns starting west of the school house, a few hundred yards from the base of the bluffs. They are using surface clay, which is probably upper Mancos decomposed. Have made few bird notes because

Felger is doing the bird work for the trip. I note the absence of {{taxon|Carpodacus mexicanus|house finches}} and lack of abundance of {taxon|Agelaius phoeniceus|red wing blackbirds}}.

	Went up the basal slope of the bluffs about half way from school house to the canyon west of it ? northwest of school house. A little ways up the slope ""float"" appeared containing fossils. Followed it up nearly to first distinct sandstone. It comes from calcareous (?see) concretions in the transition beds from the Mancos to the Mesa Verde. I collected two bags full and returned to camp at 12:20. In afternoon Felger and Robbins went with me, and we got two more bags full.

	Rained again during night, but bright and warm this morning. At 8 a.m. I started to the bluffs north of town alone. Stopped at the Review office to see editor J. L. Riland. He gave me specimens of alleged brown and black gilsonite from {{place|Piceance Creek}}, 30 or 40 miles SW of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}, and uranium and vanadium impregnated sandstone from {{place|Coal Creek, Colorado|Coal Creek}}, 16 miles NE of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}. I noted two brick kilns starting west of the school house, a few hundred yards from the base of the bluffs. They are using surface clay, which is probably upper Mancos decomposed.

miles from camp. Road is about N-S. {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} is at base of Mesa Verde formation. There is a coal mine just below our camp on west side of gulch. At {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} dip 27Â¡ SW. The {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} covers north facing slopes, opposite slopes barren. No large trees about here. Then we went upstream above camp. {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}} (large form) abundant on slopes covered by {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} and {{taxon|Cercocarpus|mt. mahogany}}. No {{taxon|Amelanchier}} (but found Amelanchier higher on slope). Only dead shells seen. Did not look for live ones. Three miles S of {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} found on E side of gulch a two foot ledge of black limestone composed almost entirely of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Anomia micronema}}.  Opposite, on west side of gulch, found same stratum, half way up the hillside. Did not find {{taxon|Tulotoma thompsoni}} which Stanton said occur here, but the bluff where they likely occur has been badly washed by recent storms. Returned to camp at 2 p.m.

miles from camp. Road is about N-S. {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} is at base of Mesa Verde formation. There is a coal mine just below our camp on west side of gulch. At {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} dip 27Â¡ SW. The {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} covers north facing slopes, opposite slopes barren. No large trees about here. Then we went upstream above camp. {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}} (large form) abundant on slopes covered by {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} and {{taxon|Cercocarpus|mt. mahogany}}. No {{taxon|Amelanchier}} (but found Amelanchier higher on slope). Only dead shells seen. Did not look for live ones. Three miles S of {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} found on E side of gulch a two foot ledge of black limestone composed almost entirely of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Anomia micronema}}.

miles from camp. Road is about N-S. {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} is at base of Mesa Verde formation. There is a coal mine just below our camp on west side of gulch. At {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} dip 27Â¡ SW. The {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} covers north facing slopes, opposite slopes barren. No large trees about here.

miles from camp. Road is about N-S. {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} is at base of Mesa Verde formation. There is a coal mine just below our camp on west side of gulch. At {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} dip 27Â¡ SW. The {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} covers north facing slopes, opposite slopes barren. No large trees about here.

miles from camp. Road is about N-S. {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} is at base of Mesa Verde formation. There is a coal mine just below our camp on west side of gulch. At {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} dip 27Â¡ SW. The {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} covers north facing slopes, opposite slopes barren. No large trees about here. Then we went upstream above camp. {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}} (large form) abundant on slopes covered by {{taxon|Quercus|oak scrub}} and {{taxon|Cercocarpus|mt. mahogany}}. No {{taxon|Amelanchier}} (but found Amelanchier higher on slope). Only dead shells seen. Did not look for live ones. Three miles S of {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}} found on E side of gulch a two foot ledge of black limestone composed almost entirely of {{taxon|Ostrea glabra}} and {{taxon|Anomia micronema}}.  Opposite, on west side of gulch, found same stratum, half way up the hillside. Did not find {{taxon|Tulotoma thompsoni}} which Stanton said occur here, but the bluff where they likely occur has been badly washed by recent storms. Returned to camp at 2 p.m.

About five miles from town we collected {{taxon|Lymnaea|Lymnaea sp.}} in small ditches  by the roadside. At the stone school house, where the river road turns south, we continued east for 2 or 3 miles, and camped on a small creek. A mere rivulet.

	Clear cold morning. Robbins and I arose at 5:30 and got our breakfast of bacon, pancakes and coffee. I went down gulch and collected {{taxon|Vallonia}}, {{taxon|Pupilla}}, {{taxon|Vitrina}}, {{taxon|Euconulus}} and {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}} in {{taxon|Populus tremuloides|aspen}} groves. Found one {{taxon|Planorbis exacuous}} and some unknown bivalve in a small natural pond (probably cut-off ox-bow loop) down stream where we saw ducks last

evening as we drove in. Saw one {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|red shafted flicker}}, one {{taxon|Tyrannus verticalis|Arkansas flycatcher}}, one {{taxon|Pipilo chlorurus|green tailed towhee}}, a lot of {{taxon|Spizella breweri|Brewer sparrows}}, {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewer blackbirds}} and {{taxon|Petrochelidon pyrrhonota|cliff swallows}}. Robbins left on horseback at noon for {{place|Newcastle, Colorado|Newcastle}}, 40 miles distant, to catch the train and return to {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} on account of his mother's illness, having failed in his effort to get telephonic or telegraphic communication. Terry and Robbins caught 3 trout this forenoon and Felger put up bird skins. Felger is now (4:45) out hunting. At 6 p.m. he came in with a lot of {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|doves}} and I cooked a trout supper. It has been a beautiful day. Threatening rain for a while in afternoon but not raining here. Mosquitoes are bad here. At dusk we set 3 traps for field mice, baiting with biscuit.

	Clear cold morning. Robbins and I arose at 5:30 and got our breakfast of bacon, pancakes and coffee. I went down gulch and collected {{taxon|Vallonia}}, {{taxon|Pupilla}}, {{taxon|Vitrina}}, {{taxon|Euconulus}} and {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}} in {{taxon|Populus tremuloides|aspen}} groves. Found one {{taxon|Planorbis exacuous}} and some unknown bivalve in a small natural pond (probably cut-off ox-bow loop) down stream where we saw ducks last

evening as we drove in. Saw one {{taxon|Colaptes auratus|red shafted flicker}}, one {{taxon|Tyrannus verticalis|Arkansas flycatcher}}, one {{taxon|Pipilo chlorurus|green tailed towhee}}, a lot of {{taxon|Spizella breweri|Brewer sparrows}}, {{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewer blackbirds}} and {{taxon|Petrochelidon pyrrhonota|cliff swallows}}. Robbins left on horseback at noon for {{place|Newcastle, Colorado|Newcastle}}, 40 miles distant, to catch the train and return to {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} on account of his mother's illness, having failed in his effort to get telephonic or telegraphic communication. Terry and Robbins caught 3 trout this forenoon and Felger put up bird skins. Felger is now (4:45) out hunting. At 6 p.m. he came in with a lot of {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|doves}} and I cooked a trout supper. It has been a beautiful day. Threatening rain for a while in afternoon but not raining here. Mosquitoes are bad here. At dusk we set 3 traps for field mice, baiting with biscuit.

At {{place|Slide Lake}}, about five miles above camp we found {{taxon|trout}} and {{taxon|water snakes}} of the species collected down stream. That must be about 8000 feet above sea level. This lake is distinctly morainal. {{place|Lower Marvine Lake}} is three miles further up and much larger. We did not visit the upper lake.

Only one large-eared {{taxon|mouse}} and a {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunk}} in the mouse traps. Terry shot two {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunks}}. I skinned one and we made rough skeleton of the other and the {{taxon|mouse}} and placed them on an anthill for the {{taxon|Formicidae|ants}} to clean. Terry caught a {{taxon|trout}} and rebaited one {{taxon|Neovison vison|mink}} trap and I rebaited the mouse traps with corn meal mush except one, which I baited with {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunk}} meat. Tried to find the {{taxon|Marmota monax|woodchuck}} which Terry saw yesterday, but failed. Smart also reported one below the cabins. Felger came into camp at 6:45 and left again at once.

Only one large-eared {{taxon|mouse}} and a {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunk}} in the mouse traps. Terry shot two {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunks}}. I skinned one and we made rough skeleton of the other and the {{taxon|mouse}} and placed them on an anthill for the {{taxon|Formicidae|ants}} to clean. Terry caught a {{taxon|trout}} and rebaited one {{taxon|Neovison vison|mink}} trap and I rebaited the mouse traps with corn meal mush except one, which I baited with {{taxon|Tamias|chipmunk}} meat. Tried to find the {{taxon|Marmota monax|woodchuck}} which Terry saw yesterday, but failed. Smart also reported one below the cabins. Felger came into camp at 6:45 and left again at once. Brought {{taxon|Oreohelix}}, {{taxon|Vitrina}}, {{taxon|Zonitoides}}, {{taxon|Pyramidula}} and {{taxon|Thysanophora}}. Partly cloudy afternoon and evening.

About a mile or two below the lake we found a swamp containing great quantities of dead {{taxon|Pisidium|Pisidium sp.}}, and {{taxon|Lymnaea bulimnoides}}, {{taxon|Planorbis parvus}}, and a larger {{taxon|Lymnaea}} but found none alive except a very few {{taxon|Pisidium}}.

to clean and prepare the skins, while I put up two {{taxon|Rodentia|rodent}} skins which Felger had skinned out at {{place|Marvine Lodge}}, and then after taking pictures, began repacking our load. Felger and Frost arrived at 4:30 p.m. with the meat. We got supper, packed the meat and at 6 p.m. we started for {{place|Buford, Colorado|Buford}} with a heavy load. It was slow travelling, particularly after dark. Camped just across river from {{place|Buford, Colorado|Buford P.O.}} at 9:20 and Felger at once began to bone the meat. It has been a warm sunny day and is not very cold tonight.

Found {{taxon|Oreohelix gabbiana|Oreohelix gabbiana}} abundant and probably O. cooperi, but no haydeni. Walked north along foot of canyon wall to NE part of town, about east of Rio Grande depot and found O. haydeni and probably O. cooperi mixed together. Did not look for live shells and did not climb slope here. Vegetation mostly mt. mahogany and scrub oak below, conifers above. No pictures on account of rain. Left Glenwood at 6:45. No sleeper accommodations and no seats except in smoker, on account of all trains being delayed and passengers thereby accumulated on this one. ",,"
