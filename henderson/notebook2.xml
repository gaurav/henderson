Ft. Collins, Colo., May 25/07

	Rained last night. Cool and somewhat cloudy this morning. Had breakfast at 6:30 a.m. Started at 7;10 with O. G. Babcock. A cold rain and fierce wind was blowing chilling us to the bone despites “slickers” and heavy lap robe. We drove through La Porte, thence to the Forks, where we took the right hand road, leaving Livermore to the left, and went about four miles further. It is quite evident that the foothill geology will be much more difficult to work out than further south, as there is much folding, which gives to the formations outcropping very irregular outlines and the folds and general flatness  of the dip spreads the formations out over a wide and decidedly variable zone, extending them into the foothills long distances in several places. We fed the team at noon at a point about 9 or 10 miles south of the Wyoming line, then turned back at 2 p.m. Drove by <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	Almost perfectly clear morning at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}. About 50 {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|piñon jays}} flew over the house at 7 a.m. going nearly north. Clouded up before 9 a.m. Left Boulder at 9:45 for {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} by C & S Ry arriving there at 11:40. Got outfit from freight depot and then went to Tiedman Hotel for dinner.

North Box Elder, Saturday {{dated|1907-06-08|June 8, 1907}}

	Rained for a little while after breakfast, and was gloomy. I was the last one up, rising when breakfast was nearly ready. At 7 a.m. there were indications of clearing up, so Dodds and I started horseback, crossing over the “Dakota” ridge . Found the “red beds” generally dipping strongly to the eastward and in places folded more or less. The Lykins ? was also folded and considerably crushed in places. In the Jurassic Dodds found some baryta. The “Dakota” exposures consisted entirely of a coarse conglomerate of sand, gravel <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

The granite lies on both sides of the lateral valley which cuts in from the north at the lower fall. In other words the lateral drainage cuts back into the granite as it does in the region of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, instead of cutting along the contact or into the sedimentaries. This is likely due to the fact that the sedimentaries were laid on a surface of weathered granite. ((at some later date Henderson wrote an emphatic “NO.” at this place in the notebook)). At any rate here the upper part of the granite is weathered, while the lower part is unaffected. If the granite were unweathered there seems no good reason why the cutting should not be in the sedimentaries as they are not particularly resistant, so<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	In afternoon we went over to {{place|South Box Elder}} and followed it down to junction with the north branch. Its lower course is very steep through granite, with gneiss about 200 or 300 ft back from the edge of the granite. The north branch runs south from the falls between the granite and the sedimentaries and just below the confluence the combined drainage turns eastward and breaks through the sedimentaries. Immediately above the confluence we found an exposure of 75 feet or more of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, varying from dark red to pure white, and extending to the creek bed. ((several lines crossed out with another “NO.”)) The granite cliffs west of the creek are high and steep, from which one may infer the ancient sea wall from which the pebbles were derived, were it not that no large boulders were observed in the conglomerate. The sedimentaries indicate uplift by their eastward dip, which<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

E and W section across {{place|North Box Elder Creek, Colorado|North Box Elder Creek}} just above confluence with south branch. ((drawing in field book, view to S with east edge on left)). The conglomerate where so well exposed is very friable and not calcareous, but a slight exposure just below the confluence effervesces freely in acid. The conglomerate is much thicker than we supposed, as we discovered a little later, with a harder band a little above the exposure just mentioned, then softer above. It answers to the Fountain formation at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} except that the cement is weak aside from the ones stratum just mentioned, so that it is covered by debris of the talus slope.

Monday {{dated|1907-06-10|June 10, 1907}}

Strong west wind but warmer than yesterday. Dodds and I started for {{place|Sand Creek, Colorado|Sand Creek}} at 8 a.m. finding a much easier trail over the high Lyons ridge and down to the creek. The east slope of the Lyons escarpment is approximately the same as the dip at the contact between the Lyons and the Lykins formations, the latter lying apparently conformably on the former toward  the base of the slope, having been eroded from the upper part of the slope. {{place|Sand Creek, Colorado|Sand Creek}}is nearly dry and the flat sandy bottom about 200 yards wide where we entered it. An elongated (N and S) hill  through which {{place|Sand Creek, Colorado|Sand Creek}}cuts about E of our camp is an anticlinal fold in the Lyons formation the west limb dipping very abruptly and the east limb approximately the normal dip for the region. An E and W fold in the same formation occurs about a mile NW of this. North of this hill the entire valley <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

There is a series of reservoirs about which large flocks of ducks and numerous large gulls were flying. The sandstone, as at Fossil Ridge, contains large numbers of {{taxon|Inoceramus oblongus}} and some of the other {{taxon|Inoceramus}} found at Fossil Ridge, but I only saw two or three {{taxon|Pinna lakesii}} and {{taxon|Baculites compressus}}, one {{taxon|Callista}}, one {{taxon|Scaphites nodosus}}, and a very few {{taxon|Ostrea|Ostrea cf.

Beginning at top of ridge we find, not the usual hard, thick bedded sandstone, but a softer thin bedded sandstone, weathering rapidly, perhaps 20 feet thick with numerous fucoids ? Below this are possibly 50 feet of sandy shales, including fossiliferous calcareous bands, the pure sands not at all calcareous. Below this 30 ft. or more of noncalcareous, thin bedded black and gray shales, much like those of the Benton and Pierre, non-fossiliferous  extending to bottom of  lateral gulch. Below this, on east slope of west ridge, friable sandstone. This is underlaid by typical hard “Dakota” sandstone and conglomerate which forms the crest of the second ridge thus:  ((drawing in field book)).

</noinclude>	The two schist  mountains shown on the map tower far above the sedimentaries flanking them. The dip of cleavage planes is very steep, dipping west, with a strike a little W of N, approximately the same as the sedimentaries to the west, and so pronounced as to make the mountain in places look as if composed of stratified rocks.  The western formations are a normal monocline. The anticline east of {{place|Masonville, Colorado|Masonville}}  seems to have overturned and developed into a thrust fault which has carried it up over the Dakota, and all the formations above the Lyons have been planed off. It seems likely that these formations formerly extended over the high mountain and joined the corresponding strata to the east in the present monocline, or rather that the strata were continuous in a more nearly level position before the development of the fold. Reached hotel at 6:15 very tired, having done a large amount of rapid climbing on foot and driven over 32 miles. Had a fine team, though skittish and headstrong.<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	Instead of attending commencement and taking my B. A. degree I started north on foot, up the Lykins lateral valley NW of {{place|Colorado Sanitarium}}. There the Lykins extends up well on the flanks of the Lyons, with Fountain at top of second hogback. Morrison sandstones, limestones and clays (latter partly calcareous) pretty well exposed. In middle of Dakota shales 2 miles N found a stratum filled with plant fragments and a few poorly preserved fish scales and vertebra. Here medial sandy shales are 90 ft. thick between the well defined walls, dip E 80˚.

The gulches south of the Tertiary bluffs expose what appear to be worked over Tertiaries. In some instances the lower exposed stratum is a conglomerate composed of the worked over red Tertiary conglomerate, and is covered by clay indistinguishable from the original Brule clay.
