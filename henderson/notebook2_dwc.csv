The granite lies on both sides of the lateral valley which cuts in from the north at the lower fall. In other words the lateral drainage cuts back into the granite as it does in the region of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, instead of cutting along the contact or into the sedimentaries. This is likely due to the fact that the sedimentaries were laid on a surface of weathered granite. ((at some later date Henderson wrote an emphatic âNO.â at this place in the notebook)). At any rate here the upper part of the granite is weathered, while the lower part is unaffected. If the granite were unweathered there seems no good reason why the cutting should not be in the sedimentaries as they are not particularly resistant, so

	In afternoon we went over to {{place|South Box Elder}} and followed it down to junction with the north branch. Its lower course is very steep through granite, with gneiss about 200 or 300 ft back from the edge of the granite. The north branch runs south from the falls between the granite and the sedimentaries and just below the confluence the combined drainage turns eastward and breaks through the sedimentaries. Immediately above the confluence we found an exposure of 75 feet or more of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, varying from dark red to pure white, and extending to the creek bed. ((several lines crossed out with another âNO.â)) The granite cliffs west of the creek are high and steep, from which one may infer the ancient sea wall from which the pebbles were derived, were it not that no large boulders were observed in the conglomerate.

The conglomerate where so well exposed is very friable and not calcareous, but a slight exposure just below the confluence effervesces freely in acid. The conglomerate is much thicker than we supposed, as we discovered a little later, with a harder band a little above the exposure just mentioned, then softer above. It answers to the Fountain formation at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} except that the cement is weak aside from the ones stratum just mentioned, so that it is covered by debris of the talus slope. Above this are the sandstones, limestones etc., which are equivalent to the Lyons formation at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, a resistant sandstone at the top forming an escarpment on the west and sloping away more gently to the east.

Its lower course is very steep through granite, with gneiss about 200 or 300 ft back from the edge of the granite. The north branch runs south from the falls between the granite and the sedimentaries and just below the confluence the combined drainage turns eastward and breaks through the sedimentaries. Immediately above the confluence we found an exposure of 75 feet or more of coarse sandstones and conglomerates, varying from dark red to pure white, and extending to the creek bed.

	East wind this morning, perfectly clear and hot. Dodds and I started N along the Fountain granite contact. In the gulch coming in to {{place|N.

S of the ranch about a mile N of {{place|Box Elder Falls}} in the lateral N and S valley is a strong outcrop of  Fountain

out in the valley, while up the slope very close to the granite is an outcrop of thin bedded reddish rock, partly fine grained and partly coarse sandstone, all of the latter outcrop effervescing freely. (This we have not found elsewhere). Between the two is an outcrop of chert containing brachiopods of Paleozoic type, which we were able to trace to where the valley  turns westward in {{place|Wyoming}}, but found no more of the underlying  calcareous rocks, but did find the Fountain. At the westward turn of the valley near head of creek in {{place|Wyoming}} we found a strong outcrop of Fountain with 6 or 8 ft. of hard gray limestone overlying it, containing numerous fragments of crinoid stems and a few poorly preserved brachiopods. It passed, apparently conformably, beneath the red, thin bedded Lyons ? sandstone (this may be limestone-see tomorrowâs notes), continuing thus northward as far as we could see. We traced the limestone nearly to the {{place|Boxelder Creek|Box Elder}} and reached camp at 6 p.m. with a good load. Saw a {{taxon|Chordeiles minor|night hawk}}  in {{place|Wyoming}}. Jackson and Crawford arrived and camped at {{place|Box Elder P.O.}} Dodds and I called in the evening and discussed plans.

	Started for mouth of {{place|Owl Creek Canyon|Owl canyon}} at 7:55 (25 minutes late on account of slowness of  livery man) with team and driver from Mt. Ave.  stable. Took the road running north from {{place|La Porte, Colorado|La Porte}}, following the Niobrara ridge most of the way. Found Benton formation mostly covered in a valley west of Niobrara, but outcropping in places as a calcareous sandstone just below  Niobrara limestone, indeed forming a trans-

-tion zone to the limestone. Niobrara about as elsewhere, the three ridges usually showing, the eastern one often making an abrupt slope to the Pierre valley. No Pierre exposed so far as I saw, occupying a rather flat undissected valley. To the east could see Fossil Creek sandstone extending northward from where I traced it yesterday. Niobrara contains {{taxon|Inoceramus deformis|I. deformis}} and {{taxon|Ostrea congesta|O. congesta}} in about the usual condition as from {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} northward. Arrived where {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}} breaks through Dakota ridge at 10:45. I got out and the driver went to the {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|Forks}} to get his dinner and feed the horses. In the upper Niobrara I noticed some tendency toward minor folds where the big ditch cuts through it 4 or 5 miles S of {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}, but I did not examine the region particularly, merely noting a few dips. At {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}(mouth of) found great numbers of {{taxon|Ostrea}} and {{taxon|Inoceramus}}. The

latter look very much like {{taxon|Inoceramus labiatus|I. labiatus}}. They occur in calcareous bands about half way down the west slope of the upper sandstone member of the Dakota ridge. Beginning at top of ridge we find, not the usual hard, thick bedded sandstone, but a softer thin bedded sandstone, weathering rapidly, perhaps 20 feet thick with numerous fucoids ? Below this are possibly 50 feet of sandy shales, including fossiliferous calcareous bands, the pure sands not at all calcareous. Below this 30 ft. or more of noncalcareous, thin bedded black and gray shales, much like those of the Benton and Pierre, non-fossiliferous  extending to bottom of  lateral gulch.

	Started for mouth of {{place|Owl Creek Canyon|Owl canyon}} at 7:55 (25 minutes late on account of slowness of  livery man) with team and driver from Mt. Ave.  stable. Took the road running north from {{place|La Porte, Colorado|La Porte}}, following the Niobrara ridge most of the way. Found Benton formation mostly covered in a valley west of Niobrara, but outcropping in places as a calcareous sandstone just below  Niobrara limestone, indeed forming a trans-

-tion zone to the limestone. Niobrara about as elsewhere, the three ridges usually showing, the eastern one often making an abrupt slope to the Pierre valley. No Pierre exposed so far as I saw, occupying a rather flat undissected valley. To the east could see Fossil Creek sandstone extending northward from where I traced it yesterday. Niobrara contains {{taxon|Inoceramus deformis|I. deformis}} and {{taxon|Ostrea congesta|O. congesta}} in about the usual condition as from {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} northward. Arrived where {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}} breaks through Dakota ridge at 10:45. I got out and the driver went to the {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|Forks}} to get his dinner and feed the horses. In the upper Niobrara I noticed some tendency toward minor folds where the big ditch cuts through it 4 or 5 miles S of {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}, but I did not examine the region particularly, merely noting a few dips. At {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}(mouth of) found great numbers of {{taxon|Ostrea}} and {{taxon|Inoceramus}}. The

At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge.

The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable.

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone.

 The Morrison from where I struck foothills south for at least several miles is covered with talus except in one or two places, which show its existence plainly. At {{place|Stout, Colorado|Stout}}, in {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} there is a 6 foot stratum of hard crystalline limestone near top of Lyons, just below Ten Sleep sandstone. The formation is much thinner than where I struck the foothills 4 Â½ miles north, not really so massive, and separated from Fountain by the same sharp line, though 40  ft down in the conglomerate  is a 10 foot band not distinguishable from the Lyons above.

At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book.

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone.

At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book.

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place.

Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book.

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}.

	Left {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|hotel}} at 7:30 on a horse from the stable back of Bellâs which makes a specialty of saddle horses. Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book.

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}.

	Left {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|hotel}} at 7:30 on a horse from the stable back of Bellâs which makes a specialty of saddle horses. Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book. Caption= Fountain purplish red coarse sand and conglomerate)).

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}.

 The Morrison from where I struck foothills south for at least several miles is covered with talus except in one or two places, which show its existence plainly. At {{place|Stout, Colorado|Stout}}, in {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} there is a 6 foot stratum of hard crystalline limestone near top of Lyons, just below Ten Sleep sandstone. The formation is much thinner than where I struck the foothills 4 Â½ miles north, not really so massive, and separated from Fountain by the same sharp line, though 40  ft down in the conglomerate  is a 10 foot band not distinguishable from the Lyons above. On the whole the appearance of the escarpment is much more like that at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl canyon}} than it was at {{place|Belleview}} (not the fold) or  4 Â½ miles north of here. Southward found a good exposure of Morrison on slope of Dakota ridge, consisting, as usual of soft, variously tinted sandstones  and shales, underlaid by Lykins thin bedded, red sandy  shales, including massive layer in

	Left {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|hotel}} at 7:30 on a horse from the stable back of Bellâs which makes a specialty of saddle horses. Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book. Caption= Fountain purplish red coarse sand and conglomerate)).

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}. Cross bedding in Lykins ridge at {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} thus ((drawing in field book)).

 The Morrison from where I struck foothills south for at least several miles is covered with talus except in one or two places, which show its existence plainly. At {{place|Stout, Colorado|Stout}}, in {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} there is a 6 foot stratum of hard crystalline limestone near top of Lyons, just below Ten Sleep sandstone. The formation is much thinner than where I struck the foothills 4 Â½ miles north, not really so massive, and separated from Fountain by the same sharp line, though 40  ft down in the conglomerate  is a 10 foot band not distinguishable from the Lyons above. On the whole the appearance of the escarpment is much more like that at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl canyon}} than it was at {{place|Belleview}} (not the fold) or  4 Â½ miles north of here. Southward found a good exposure of Morrison on slope of Dakota ridge, consisting, as usual of soft, variously tinted sandstones  and shales, underlaid by Lykins thin bedded, red sandy  shales, including massive layer in

A little further south about 25 or 30 feet of hard limestone is exposed at top of Morrison and formation seems much thicker.

	Left {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|hotel}} at 7:30 on a horse from the stable back of Bellâs which makes a specialty of saddle horses. Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book. Caption= Fountain purplish red coarse sand and conglomerate)).

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}.

 The Morrison from where I struck foothills south for at least several miles is covered with talus except in one or two places, which show its existence plainly. At {{place|Stout, Colorado|Stout}}, in {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} there is a 6 foot stratum of hard crystalline limestone near top of Lyons, just below Ten Sleep sandstone. The formation is much thinner than where I struck the foothills 4 Â½ miles north, not really so massive, and separated from Fountain by the same sharp line, though 40  ft down in the conglomerate  is a 10 foot band not distinguishable from the Lyons above. On the whole the appearance of the escarpment is much more like that at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl canyon}} than it was at {{place|Belleview}} (not the fold) or  4 Â½ miles north of here. Southward found a good exposure of Morrison on slope of Dakota ridge, consisting, as usual of soft, variously tinted sandstones  and shales, underlaid by Lykins thin bedded, red sandy  shales, including massive layer in

A little further south about 25 or 30 feet of hard limestone is exposed at top of Morrison and formation seems much thicker.

	Left {{place|Forks Hotel, Livermore, Colorado|hotel}} at 7:30 on a horse from the stable back of Bellâs which makes a specialty of saddle horses. Road west on road which crosses the railroad at the Passenger depot. At mouth of gulch  found Niobrara and Benton in usual position, all covered except basal Niobrara limestone, which makes  a low ridge. The lower Benton, however, has been rather extensively quarried for brick making south of the road, making a fair exposure, in the upper part of which I found a thin bed of {{taxon|Ostrea}}, apparently the same undescribed species found at {{place|Six Mile}}, N of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}, and in the

same condition, with other thin limestone strata above it. Here the Dakota forms 3 distinct benches. The Lykins has a dip of 27Ë, the medial ridge making member rises nearly as high as the Lyons, with the valley consisting of a lateral running each way from the pass, but not very deep at the pass thus: ((drawing in field book)). The Lykins and the Lyons are both quarried, the former to a limited extent, the latter extensively. The Lyons furnishes large, fine blocks of flawless sandstone of a uniform red color, not very intense red. It is much thicker here than a short distance northward, massive and uniform, sharply differentiated from the Fountain in the escarpment  both in texture and color, but conformable. The basal and (?) third beds 15 or 20 ft thick are strongly crossbedded in the escarpment where it faces SW, thus:  ((drawing in field book. Caption= Fountain purplish red coarse sand and conglomerate)).

 A large part of the Fountain here is quite calcareous, in places might be called limestones almost. It passes abruptly into noncalcareous fine red sandstone above, but conformably. Could find no fossils. There are probably over 200 feet of Fountain and same amount of Lyons  up to Ten Sleep sandstone. There is a little lime in  Lyons in places above base but no well defined horizons and no limestone. In Lykins above the cross bedded sandstone is a limestone band similar to that at {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}} which has been burned for lime. The Dakota has been quarried a little at one place. The Fountain is friable and occupies a north and south valley  as northward with tendency to harden at very base as at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl Canyon}}. Cross bedding in Lykins ridge at {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} thus ((drawing in field book)).

 The Morrison from where I struck foothills south for at least several miles is covered with talus except in one or two places, which show its existence plainly. At {{place|Stout, Colorado|Stout}}, in {{place|Spring Canyon, Colorado|Spring Canyon}} there is a 6 foot stratum of hard crystalline limestone near top of Lyons, just below Ten Sleep sandstone. The formation is much thinner than where I struck the foothills 4 Â½ miles north, not really so massive, and separated from Fountain by the same sharp line, though 40  ft down in the conglomerate  is a 10 foot band not distinguishable from the Lyons above. On the whole the appearance of the escarpment is much more like that at {{place|Owl Creek Canyon, Colorado|Owl canyon}} than it was at {{place|Belleview}} (not the fold) or  4 Â½ miles north of here. Southward found a good exposure of Morrison on slope of Dakota ridge, consisting, as usual of soft, variously tinted sandstones  and shales, underlaid by Lykins thin bedded, red sandy  shales, including massive layer in

A little further south about 25 or 30 feet of hard limestone is exposed at top of Morrison and formation seems much thicker.

{{taxon|Sturnella|Meadowlarks}}- abundant and singing in the valley as far west in the mountains as I have been, 4 miles west of {{place|Livermore, Colorado|Livermore}}.
{{taxon|Turdus migratorius|Robins}}- Common in valley in flocks. Have not noticed them closely, but this morning noticed one {{taxon|Turdus migratorius migratorius|M. migratorius}} with flock of {{taxon|Turdus migratorius propinquus|M. m. propinqus}}.

{{taxon|Circus cyaneus|Marsh Hawk}}- have seen a number, always singly
{{taxon|Agelaius phoeniceus|Red Winged Blackbird}} â quite common, have seen no large flocks yet.
{{taxon|Euphagus cyanocephalus|Brewer blackbird}}- a few
{{taxon|Pooecetes gramineus|Vesper sparrow}}- a few
{{taxon|Eremophila alpestris|Shore larks}}- common, especially in the mountains (foothills)
{{taxon|Larus delawarensis|Gulls- probably ring billed}} â numbers on {{place|Rocky Ridge Reservoir}}
Ducks- same as gulls

	The two schist  mountains shown on the map tower far above the sedimentaries flanking them. The dip of cleavage planes is very steep, dipping west, with a strike a little W of N, approximately the same as the sedimentaries to the west, and so pronounced as to make the mountain in places look as if composed of stratified rocks.  The western formations are a normal monocline. The anticline east of {{place|Masonville, Colorado|Masonville}}  seems to have overturned and developed into a thrust fault which has carried it up over the Dakota, and all the formations above the Lyons have been planed off. It seems likely that these formations formerly extended over the high mountain and joined the corresponding strata to the east in the present monocline, or rather that the strata were continuous in a more nearly level position before the development of the fold. Reached hotel at 6:15 very tired, having done a large amount of rapid climbing on foot and driven over 32 miles. Had a fine team, though skittish and headstrong.

	The two schist  mountains shown on the map tower far above the sedimentaries flanking them. The dip of cleavage planes is very steep, dipping west, with a strike a little W of N, approximately the same as the sedimentaries to the west, and so pronounced as to make the mountain in places look as if composed of stratified rocks.  The western formations are a normal monocline. The anticline east of {{place|Masonville, Colorado|Masonville}}  seems to have overturned and developed into a thrust fault which has carried it up over the Dakota, and all the formations above the Lyons have been planed off. It seems likely that these formations formerly extended over the high mountain and joined the corresponding strata to the east in the present monocline, or rather that the strata were continuous in a more nearly level position before the development of the fold. Reached hotel at 6:15 very tired, having done a large amount of rapid climbing on foot and driven over 32 miles. Had a fine team, though skittish and headstrong.

Following birds were overlooked in {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} list made yesterday. 
{{taxon|Corvus|Crows}}- saw some several times in the valley and 29 in one flock in the foothills. 
{{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|Long crested jay}}- abundant in foothills
{{taxon|Magpie}}- common in valley and foothills
{{taxon|Towhees}}- spurred or arctic, do not know which, abundant along foothills in brushy places
A large hawk- probably {{taxon|Buteo swainsonii|Swainsonâs}} or {{taxon|Buteo jamaicensis|red tailed (western)}}
{{taxon|Colaptes|Flicker}}- common

	Started with team at 7:30 a.m. West of {{place|Stever Reservoir}} found {{place|Tepee Buttes}} with {{taxon|Baculites  compressus}}, {{taxon|Ostrea inornata}} and {{taxon|Lucina occidentalis}} in quantities but in poor condition.  There were many fossil fragments. Did not stop to collect any. Found also {{taxon|Inoceramus barabini}}, fragments of a large {{taxon|Heteroceras}} and probably a medium sized {{taxon|Ptychoceras}}. 150 yards W of the buttes The Hygiene sandstone is found dipping east about 15Ë, not at all calcareous. To the west the basal Pierre shales and Niobrara dip E 42Ë, the Benton shales are somewhat crushed and the boulder mesa cap over the Benton is well consolidated. Just within the canyon the Dakota is badly tangled. A section of the medial shales is thus:

The strong capping limestone of the Morrison can be followed around the north end of the syncline via {{place|Carter Lake, Colorado|Carter Lake}}. The west limb of the anticline, as usual, is steeper than the east limb, from 55 to 80 degrees.

	Started with sorrel team at 7:30. Drove W and then S. Just before reaching {{place|Little Thompson Creek, Colorado|Little Thompson}} on road next to foothills found a sandstone E of typical Hygiene. It was soft and fine grained below with a with a two foot hard and coarse stratum  of darker color than the other. On E side {{place|Rabbit Creek, Colorado|Rabbit}} we have an unusual case of an anticline with E limb much steeper than west limb. Killed a {{taxon|rattlesnake}} on Dakota Ridge W of {{place|Lykins Ranch|Lykins ranch}}. Struck an outcrop SW of town and E of the Hygiene (1 Â½ or 2 mi.) which looks much like concretions of Fossil Creek sandstone, but

Berthoud, Oct 18, 1907

	Started at 8:30 driving west and north. Hazy over the mountains and a cold northerly breeze blowing, changing later to easterly. North of Lone Tree Lake I found a strong outcrop of typical Hygiene sandstone dipping SE, 15Ë, continuing NE to SW corner of Loveland. Its strike continued SE would about meet the outcrop west of Berthoud. No fossils.

{{taxon|Inoceramus barabini}}, {{taxon|Inoceramus oblongus|I. oblongus}} and {{taxon|Anomia rectiformis}}, all poorly preserved. I have now no doubt of its identity with the Fossil Ridge sandstone . Passing thence around the east side of the lake the {{taxon|Inoceramus oblongus}} increased rapidly in numbers and I found several {{taxon|Scaphites nodosus}}. Found no outcrop at extreme north end of lake . Thick sheet of clay exposed. In bottom of outlet ditch there appears to be a soft sandstone, probably the same one as at the south end. Along east side sandstone is unmistakably the Fossil Ridge  formation. The fossils at Fossil Ridge are mostly in upper part (eastern part of exposure) as here. Passed northward then along RR track. Saw occasional evidence of the sandstone on both sides of the track and believe the ridge east of  track  all the way is composed of it as at Fossil Ridge. Reached {{place|Trilby Schoolhouse Road|Trilby Schoolhouse road}} road at 4:45 and found

Dodds with horse and buggy. We reached {{place|Hotel Northern}} at {{place|Ft. Collins, Colorado|Ft. Collins}} at 6 p.m. There seems now no possible doubt about the Fossil Ridge sandstone being continuous with the Hygiene.

In upper part are strong l.s. beds The cliff forms several benches. The upper 50 ft capped by strong  l.s. is particularly Lyons like. The l.s. contains crinoid stems and {{taxon|Productus cora}}. After lunch we drove to {{place|Owl Creek Canyon|Owl Canyon}}. S of the canyon the 2 upper benches are capped by l.s. and between them and below the lower one are thick bands (12-15 ft.)of thin bedded, pinkish, crossbedded s.s. just like the s.s. overlying the upper s.s. which Darton calls the Ten Sleep. Here, as on {{place|Tenmile Creek, Colorado|Ten Mile Creek}}, the Fountain is not nearly as conglomeratic as it is southward. The Carboniferous escarpment, except for the l.s. beds is just as in the Belleview fold above the Fountain. Below the limestones the sandstones and conglomerates are decidedly darker, less of a pink and

	Bright, cold morning arose at 6 a.m. Started W on foot at 7:15. At {{place|Carr, Colorado|Carr}} the pure white Laramie s.s. with iron concretions out-

crops, overlaid by granite and gneiss debris, with s.s fragments more common to the westward. Some of the granite boulders are a foot in diameter. In the bluffs NE of {{place|Round Butte}} a massive s.s., light colored but not white, which I supposed Laramie, proved to contain Fox Hills spp about half way up. . It was about 40 feet thick at east end, underlaid by dark (Pierre?) shales and unconformably overlaid by a very hard pink to red conglomerate, mostly granite pebbles etc. up to half an inch in diameter, looking just as portions of the Fountain except for larger sandstone fragments contained up to 2 ft in diameter. The F.H. s.s. thins out to the west and then the conglomerate is eroded away leaving the Pierre exposed toward the foothills. Reached a ranch on sec 10 and got some alkali water out of a spring  at 1 p.m. then climbed the foothills and went N along the âDakotaâ ridge to where the Tertiary transgresses its edges. Here the âDakotaâ has an
