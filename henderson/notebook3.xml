	Found no yellow ss in Jurassic at mouth of canyon, but the l.s. containing the fossils (of which we have had slides made) and one foot (or more) concretionary zone is present. In isolated hill inside mouth of canyon the deep red Lykins passes above into pinkish roundly massive s.s., which abruptly changes to whitish, in turn abruptly but apparently conformably into angular yellow s.s. Probably that in which Hayden found {{taxon|Pentacrinus|Pentacrinus}} and {{taxon|Ostrea}}. Above this is the fossiliferous l.s. At one point there is a marked unconformity near base of Jura for 50 ft thus  ((drawing in field book)).

	Hot bright morning. Up at 6:30, broke camp and started for {{place|Piceance Creek, Colorado|Pieance (sic) Creek}} at 8:30. Put on the odometer after travelling one mile by mile post. Saw {{taxon|Sturnella|meadowlarks}}, {{taxon|Zenaida macroura|mourning doves}}, many {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|pi?on jays}}, {{taxon|Cyanocitta stelleri|long crested jays}}, {{taxon|Tyrranus verticalis|Arkansas flycatchers}}, one {{taxon|Piranga ludoviciana|Louisiana tanager}}, {{taxon|Salpinctes obsoletus|rock wren}}. As we passed out of the gap we found sandstones etc, dipping to the S or SW about 10ยฐ. These I take for Wasatch. Between these and the Mesa Verde sandstones are varicolored marls which surely are Wasatch. I believe that the entire series from the upper Mesa Verde sandstones to the top of the {{place|Book Cliffs}} is probably referable to Wasatch.

	Rained again during night, but bright and warm this morning. At 8 a.m. I started to the bluffs north of town alone. Stopped at the Review office to see editor J. L. Riland. He gave me specimens of alleged brown and black gilsonite from {{place|Piceance Creek}}, 30 or 40 miles SW of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}, and uranium and vanadium impregnated sandstone from {{place|Coal Creek, Colorado|Coal Creek}}, 16 miles NE of {{place|Meeker, Colorado|Meeker}}. I noted two brick kilns starting west of the school house, a few hundred yards from the base of the bluffs. They are using surface clay, which is probably upper Mancos decomposed.

</noinclude>Felger is doing the bird work for the trip. I note the absence of {{taxon|Carpodacus mexicanus|house finches}} and lack of abundance of {taxon|Agelaius phoeniceus|red wing blackbirds}}. Every where {{taxon|Sialia|bluebirds (S. arctica)}} have been common. {{taxon|Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus|Pi?on jays}} are abundant locally. A few {taxon|magpie|magpies}} occasionally. 
	Went up the basal slope of the bluffs about half way from school house to the canyon west of it ? northwest of school house. A little ways up the slope "float" appeared containing fossils. Followed it up nearly to first distinct sandstone. It comes from calcareous (?see) concretions in the transition beds from the Mancos to the Mesa Verde. I collected two bags full and returned to camp at 12:20. In afternoon Felger and Robbins went with me, and we got two more bags full.

	Bright hot morning Terry and I started north on foot about 8:30, Felger and Robbins going around through town with the wagons to leave the boxes which are to be shipped. Visited the low shaley sandstone ridge which starts NE of town and runs NE. It resembles portions of the Hygiene sandstone north of {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}. It appears to be near the middle of the Mancos formation. Coming north we found the {{taxon|Cynomys leucurus|white tailed prairie dog}}, {{taxon|Sciuridae|large ground squirrel}} and {{taxon|Marmota monax|woodchucks}} abundant. {{taxon|Turdus migratorius|Robins}} not very common. {{taxon|Sayornis saya|Say phoebe}} occasional. Camped just above ranch about 3 or 4 miles south of {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial P.O.}} about 6 p.m. Water bad. Collected {{taxon|Marmota monax|woodchucks}}, {{taxon|Cynomys leucurus|prairie dogs}}, and {{taxon|Sciuridae|ground squirrels}}.

	Got up late. Bright and hot until 3 p.m., then cooler and sprinkled. In forenoon we finished putting up the {{taxon|Taxidea taxus|badger}} skin. In Afternoon Robbins worked on {{taxon|Cynomys leucurus|prairie dog}} and {{taxon|Sciuridae|squirrel}} skins. We also aired all the bedding. For dinner we had beef pot roast, dumplings and brown potatoes. Pretty "swell" for camp life. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	Sprinkled considerably during the night, but was unusually warm. Bright, hot morning. While Felger and Robbins finished putting up the mammal skins, I went up town and ordered supplies. In afternoon Robbins, Felger and I drove up town to the Review office with our specimens, got the boxes we had stored there before going to {{place|Axial, Colorado|Axial}}, packed and shipped them. We sent one big box of mammals and birds, one of plants, and one of mollusks  etc. by express and two boxes and a keg of fossils by freight, the stage company taking all to {{place|Rifle, Colorado|Rifle}}  and shipping from there to {{place|Boulder, Colorado|Boulder}}.

	Partly cloudy morning. Up at 7 a.m. Found 2 mice in traps. Set Terry to collecting plants in Robbins' place. I put up the mice while Felger put up birds. At noon it rained hard and hailed for a long time and continued to drizzle for most of the afternoon. At 4 p.m. we had dinner consisting chiefly of nine mourning doves, a real treat. I boiled and washed a large number of dish cloths and towels in the afternoon. Have had wet boots all afternoon from wading in the weeds in search of dry wood. Cut down 2 dead trees. At six p.m. Felger and I set 8 traps. I found a number of {{taxon|Succinea|Succinea sp.}} on logs at the water's edge, and a single {{taxon|Aplexa hyperorum}} in the water of a small channel of <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	Lost my fountain pen, so must use lead pencil for balance of trip. A beautiful morning. We got saddles for our horses and an extra saddle horse at the lodge  and started up the creek at 9:55. Just above camp are two depressions which must be of glacial origin. The large is about 50 feet wide and 20 feet deep, nearly circular. Proceeding up gulch such depressions become more common and soon the typical hummocky topography of glaciated regions is found. Most of the depressions are dry. The stream and glacial debris is all volcanic, a dark colored lava, weathering gray, containing many zeolites, surface of many boulders pitted by solution of the zeolites. The road ends about a mile up<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Then I worked at repacking our load and got the portion which is here in much better shape. At 9:30 I built a fire to take off the growing chill of a September night at 8000 feet above sea level and prepared to spend the night without bedding, shelter or water to drink. The first task now is to get my boots dry, as they are wringing wet. It is now (10 p.m.) clear and beautiful, as the moon is arising above the treetops. This certainly has been a strenuous afternoon. At 11 o'clock I crawled under the wagon with the slicker about me and laid<noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

	At 2 p.m. (sic) it got too cold for me under the wagon, so I got up, replenished the fire and laid down before it the balance of the night. An old bull kept rumbling around all night and toward morning the {{taxon|Canis latrans|coyotes}} were noisy. At 4 a.m. it clouded up and rained gently until after daylight. I arose at 6 a.m., fried some ham, baked potatoes in the ashes  and ate my breakfast. Finished packing the part of the load that is at the wagon, harnessed the horses and collected {{taxon|Euconulus}}, {{taxon|Vitrina}} and {{taxon|Pupillidae}} and saw some {{taxon|Oreohelix cooperi}}. Felger arrived at about 9 a.m. with A. J. La Kamp and son Henry, who brought up the part of the load "ditched" yesterday, with a <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

About 1 p.m. we fed the horses at {{place|Mud Spring}}. The water was cold and good. Road quite hilly from there south until one started into gulch leading into {{place|Dry Elk Creek}}, after which it is down grade to {{place|Newcastle, Colorado|Newcastle}}. Reached Newcastle-{{place|Rifle Gap State Park|Rifle Gap}} road about seven miles above {{place|Newcastle, Colorado|Newcastle. It began to rain just before starting down grade and continued until we reached town at about 9 p.m. Road was slippery, badly washed and the latter part of the trip so dark that Terry walked ahead  with the lantern for safety. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>

Found {{taxon|Oreohelix gabbiana|Oreohelix gabbiana}} abundant and probably O. cooperi, but no haydeni. Walked north along foot of canyon wall to NE part of town, about east of Rio Grande depot and found O. haydeni and probably O. cooperi mixed together. Did not look for live shells and did not climb slope here. Vegetation mostly mt. mahogany and scrub oak below, conifers above. No pictures on account of rain. Left Glenwood at 6:45. No sleeper accommodations and no seats except in smoker, on account of all trains being delayed and passengers thereby accumulated on this one. <noinclude><references/></div></noinclude>]]></content>
